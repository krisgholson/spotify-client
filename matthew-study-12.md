Book Three: Growing Controversy and the New Kingdom, Narrative: Jesus Confronts an Evil Generation

### Questions / Notes

1. (1-8) This is a richer story than many people realize. Read the original telling in [1 Sam 21:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Sam%2021%3A1-6&version=RSVCE). Also read Mark's version of what Jesus told the Pharisees [Mark 2:23-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A23-28&version=RSVCE). In 1 Samuel, who was the priest that provided David and his men with the showbread? (Answer: Ahim′elech). In Mark, who does Jesus say the high priest was? (Answer: Abi′athar) What is going on here? Did Jesus misquote scripture? Probably not. Here are the notes from the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible for the Mark version of this episode: `The priest who provided David with bread was actually Ahimelech, Abiathar's father (1 Sam 21:1). This apparent discrepancy causes some modern scholars to accuse Jesus of misquoting Scripture, although this conclusion is unnecessary. • Jesus probably mentioned Abiathar instead of Ahimelech to post a warning for the Pharisees. Abiathar is infamous in OT history as the last high priest of his line, who was banished from Jerusalem and the priesthood for opposing Solomon, the son of David and the heir of his kingdom (1 Kings 2:26-27). He thus represents the end of an old order that passes away with the coming of David's royal successor. As Jesus compares himself and the disciples with David and his men, he likewise draws the Pharl sees into the story by casting them as figures like Abiathar. The Pharisees, then, represent an old order of covenant leadership that is about to expire, and it they persist in their opposition to Jesus, the new heir of the Davidic kingdom, they will meet the same disastrous fate that befell Abiathar. Jesus' allusion to this OT tradition was a subtle yet strategic way to caution the Pharisees against their antagonism to his ministry.`
2. (5) What does it mean that the priests in the temple "profane the sabbath and are guiltless"? (Answer: it means they were/are permitted to work on the sabbath - their work was/is to help the people to lift their burdens (be forgiven their sins).)
3. (6) Something "greater than the temple" is here. Read the "New Temple" section of [Jesus and the OT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPs5eQ5ofHthVH2YFddzNM--a7dvpUn-/view?usp=drive_link) for how the Jerusalem Temple was a TYPE of Jesus.
4. (7) "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice" - Matthew recorded these same words that Jesus said to the pharisees earlier in his gospel ([Matt 9:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%209%3A13&version=RSVCE)). Read [Hos 6:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hos%206%3A1-11&version=RSVCE) to read the rebuke against E′phraim (northern kingdom) and Judah (southern kingdom) and consider what lesson the Pharisees should be learning. 
5. (9-14) In summary - the Sabbath forbids servile works, not works of mercy.
6. (14) "took counsel". See the same reference made to the Pharisees later in the Gospel [Matt 27:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2027%3A1&version=RSVCE). Matthew is alluding to this [Ps 2:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%202%3A1-3&version=RSVCE) when the rulers "take counsel together, against the Lord and his annointed" (i.e. the Messiah)
7. (15-21) Quote from [Is 42:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2042%3A1-4&version=RSVCE) "Servant" can also be translated "son" - remember that we heard the Father evoke this passage at Jesus' baptism. How is this Isaiah citation fulfilled in Jesus' actions in verses 15-16?
8. (23) "the Son of David?" The question reflects the Jewish tradition that King Solomon, the son of David, was empowered by God to exorcise demons [Wis 7:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wis%207%3A20&version=RSVCE). Similar abilities were expected of the coming Messiah. 
9. (24) The Pharisees blaspheme against the Spirt by attributing to Satan ("the prince of demons") the work of God. 
10. (29) Who is the "strong man" in Jesus' story? (Answer: Satan) Who binds him? (Answer: Jesus) What are the goods being plundered from the strong man's house? (Answer: those souls who were previously possessed by Satan) 
11. (36-37) It sounds like spoken insults call down God's judgment. We heard something similar from Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount - [Matt 5:21-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A21-26&version=RSVCE). Verse 37 in my translation reads ".. for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."  Compare what Jesus said there to what Paul says in [Rom 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%203%3A28&version=RSVCE) - "For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law". How do you reconcile these seemingly conflicting definitions of what justifies us (save us) before God.  What did Paul mean by "apart from works of law"? You may have to read all of [Romans 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203&version=RSVCE) and [Works Mattered to St. Paul](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/works-mattered-to-st-paul) to really get the gist of what "works of law" Paul is referring to in Romans 3:28. (I'm making this contrast because I would like you to consider the perspective that the Reformers doctrine of "sola fide" or "justification by faith alone" is based on a misinterpretation of Paul.)
12. (38-41) The men of Ninevah repented and the city of Ninevah was saved. The Jewish leaders of Jesus' day did not repent and the Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D. The Sign of Jonah. See "New Jonah" here [Jesus and the OT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPs5eQ5ofHthVH2YFddzNM--a7dvpUn-/view?usp=drive_link).
13. (42) Like the GENTILE men of Nineveh could figure out that Jonah was a prophet of God, the GENTILE queen of Sheba could figure out that Solomon's wisdom was a blessing from God [1 Kings 10:1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2010%3A1-13&version=RSVCE). See "New Solomon" here [Jesus and the OT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPs5eQ5ofHthVH2YFddzNM--a7dvpUn-/view?usp=drive_link).
14. (38-42) What is Jesus's point with these OT stories and how does it answer the scribes and Pharisees request for a sign in verse 38?
