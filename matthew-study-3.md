### Questions 
1. "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." (3:2) "Kingdom of heaven" == "Kingdom of God" is the central theme of Matthew (expression appears more than 30 times throughout the book). What did John (and later Jesus) mean by "kingdom of heaven"? (Obviously this is big question that we'll answer throughout our study - keep it in mind as we continue)
