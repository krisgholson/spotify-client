# Gospel According to Matthew Bible Study

## Chapter 6

Book One: John the Baptist and the Early Ministry of Jesus, Discourse: Sermon on the Mount

### Questions

1. (1-18) Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving were/are 3 traditional works of mercy honored by the Jews [Tob 12:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tob%2012%3A8-10&version=RSVCE). Jesus wants us to do them ("*When* you give alms/pray/fast ..."), but what is he warning us against doing? Is Jesus saying that public displays of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving should be avoided? (Notice again that Jesus references "rewards" in Heaven for our actions on Earth.)
1. (2) Who was Jesus primarily referring to when he called out "hypocrites"? What did the term "hypocrites" mean in this context?
1. (7) The "empty phrases" and "many words" of the Gentiles' prayers refers to the empty Pagan practices of reciting long litanies of divine names to gain the attention of gods. Is Jesus warning us against repetitive or lengthy prayers [Mat 26:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2026%3A44&version=RSVCE), [Lk 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206%3A12&version=RSVCE) ? 
1. (9-13) Jesus gives us the Our Father as a model prayer. What are the 7 petitions in the prayer? How are the first 3 related? How are the last 4 related? 
1. (9) What does "Hallowed be thy name" mean?
1. (11) The Greek "epiousios" (translated "daily") is used only here in Matthew and in Luke's re-telling of the Our Father. It is an [obscure Greek word](https://thinkingwest.com/2020/04/17/epiousios-greek-our-father/) not previously found in literature UNTIL the New Testament. It probably means something like "for the being" or maybe "super-essential". It (maybe obviously) refers to the necessities of life such as food. However, several Church Fathers (including [St. Augustine](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/160307.htm)) interpret "daily bread" as a reference to the Eucharist. Consider also the Bread of Life discourse ([Jn 6:30-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%206%3A30-40&version=RSVCE)) where Jesus calls himself the bread of life. How do you read Jesus' meaning of the "daily bread" petition in the Our Father?
