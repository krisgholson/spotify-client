    "description": "To support the\u00a0ministry and get access to exclusive content, go to: http://patreon.com/logicalbiblestudy  Matthew 7: 7-12- 'Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find.'  Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2609 (in Jesus teaches us how to pray) - Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He can ask us to \"seek\" and to \"knock,\" since he himself is the door and the way. - 1789 (in 'Moral Conscience') - Some rules apply in every case: - One may never do evil so that good may result from it; - The Golden Rule: \"Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.\" - 1970 (in 'The New Law') - The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice between \"the two ways\" and to put into practice the words of the Lord. It is summed up in the Golden Rule, \"Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the prophets.\"  Got a Bible question?
