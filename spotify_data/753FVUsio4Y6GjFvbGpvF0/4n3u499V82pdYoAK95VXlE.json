Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 439 (in 'Christ') - Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messianic \"Son of David\", promised by God to Israel. Jesus accepted his rightful title of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by some of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially political. - 448 (in 'Lord') - Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as \"Lord\". This title testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach him for help and healing (abbreviated). - 2610 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - Jesus is as saddened by the \"lack of faith\" of his own neighbors and the \"little faith\" of his own disciples as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the Canaanite woman (abbreviated).
