Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 87 (in 'The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church') - Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: \"He who hears you, hears me\", The faithful receive with docility the teachings and directives that their pastors give them in different forms. - 858 (in 'The Apostles' Mission') - Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry, he \"called to him those whom he desired; .... and he appointed twelve, whom also he named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach.\" From then on, they would also be his \"emissaries\" (Greek apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his own mission: \"As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\" The apostles' ministry is the continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: \"he who receives you receives me.\"  Got a Bible question?
