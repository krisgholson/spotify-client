Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 993 (in 'The Progressive Nature of the Resurrection') - The Pharisees and many of the Lord's contemporaries hoped for the resurrection. Jesus teaches it firmly. To the Sadducees who deny it he answers, \"Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God?\" Faith in the resurrection rests on faith in God who \"is not God of the dead, but of the living.\" - 1619 (in 'Virginity for the Sake of the Kingdom') - Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an unfolding of baptismal grace, a powerful sign of the supremacy of the bond with Christ and of the ardent expectation of his return, a sign which also recalls that marriage is a reality of this present age which is passing away.
