Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1286 (in 'Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation') - In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving mission (abbreviated). - 436 (in 'Christ') - It was necessary that the Messiah be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord at once as king and priest, and also as prophet. Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet, and king (abbreviated). - 695 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - Its full force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew \u201cmessiah\u201d) means the one \u201canointed\u201d by God\u2019s Spirit. There were several anointed ones of the Lord in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently King David. But Jesus is God\u2019s Anointed in a unique way: the humanity the Son assumed was entirely anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit established him as \u201cChrist\" (abbreviated). - 714 (in 'Expectations of the Messiah and his spirit') - This is why Christ inaugurates the proclamation of the Good News by making his own the following passage from Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor. - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to \u201cpreach good news to the poor\u201d (abbreviated). - 2443 (in 'Love for the Poor') - When \u201cthe poor have the good news preached to them,\u201d it is the sign of Christ\u2019s presence (abbreviated). - 1168 (in 'The Liturgical Year') - Beginning with the Easter Triduum as its source of light, the new age of the Resurrection fills the whole liturgical year with its brilliance. Gradually, on either side of this source, the year is transfigured by the liturgy. It really is a \u201cyear of the Lord\u2019s favor\" (abbreviated)  Got a Bible question?
