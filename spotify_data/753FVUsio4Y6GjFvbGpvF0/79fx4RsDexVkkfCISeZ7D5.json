Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 644 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are still doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were seeing a ghost. \"In their joy they were still disbelieving and still wondering.\"...Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up. On the contrary their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action of divine grace, from their direct experience of the reality of the risen Jesus. - 645 (in 'The Condition of Christ's Risen Humanity') - By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion. Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine realm. For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith. - 999 (in 'How do the dead rise?') - How? Christ is raised with his own body: \"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself\"; but he did not return to an earthly life. So, in him, \"all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear,\" but Christ \"will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body,\" into a \"spiritual body.\" (abbreviated). - 652 (in 'The Meaning and Saving Significance of the Resurrection') - Christ's Resurrection is the fulfilment of the promises both of the Old Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly life. The phrase \"in accordance with the Scriptures\" indicates that Christ's Resurrection fulfilled these predictions. - 112 (in 'The Holy Spirit, interpreter of Scripture') - Be especially attentive \"to the content and unity of the whole Scripture\". Different as the books which compose it may be, Scripture is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus is the center and heart, open since his Passover. - 108 (in 'The Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture') - If the Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ, the eternal Word of the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit, \"open (our) minds to understand the Scriptures.\" (abbreviated). - 2763 (in 'The Summary of the Whole Gospel') - All the Scriptures - the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms - are fulfilled in Christ. The Gospel is this \"Good News\" (abbreviated). - 2625 (in 'The Age of the Church') - 601 (in 'He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures') - 981 (in 'The Power of the Keys') - 1120 (in 'The Sacraments of the Church') - 1122 (in 'The Sacraments of Faith') - 1304 (in 'Confirmation')  Got a Bible question?
