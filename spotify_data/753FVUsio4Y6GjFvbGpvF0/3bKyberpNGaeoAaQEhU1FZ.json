Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 535 (in 'The Baptism of Jesus') - Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches \"a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins\". A crowd of sinners - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by him (abbreviated). - 2447 (in 'Love for the Poor') - The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. the corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead. Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to God. - 696 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - John the Baptist, who goes \"before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah,\" proclaims Christ as the one who \"will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" Jesus will say of the Spirit: \"I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!\" (abbreviated).
