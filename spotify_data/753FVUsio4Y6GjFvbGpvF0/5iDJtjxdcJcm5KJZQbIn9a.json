Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 765 (in 'The Church - Instituted by Christ Jesus') - The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ's mission and his power, but also in his lot (abbreviated). - 2611 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - The prayer of faith consists not only in saying \"Lord, Lord,\" but in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father. Jesus calls his disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for cooperating with the divine plan. - 2122 (in 'Irreligion') - The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the sacraments beyond the offerings defined by the competent authority, always being careful that the needy are not deprived of the help of the sacraments because of their poverty.\" The competent authority determines these \"offerings\" in accordance with the principle that the Christian people ought to contribute to the support of the Church's ministers. \"The laborer deserves his food.\"  Got a Bible question?
