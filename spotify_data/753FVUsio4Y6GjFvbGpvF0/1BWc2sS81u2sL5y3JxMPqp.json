Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 548 (in 'The Signs of the Kingdom of God') - The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent him. They invite belief in him. To those who turn to him in faith, he grants what they ask. So miracles strengthen faith in the One who does his Father's works; they bear witness that he is the Son of God (abbreviated). - 583 (in 'Jesus and the Temple') - His public ministry itself was patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish Feasts (abbreviated). - 590 (in 'Jesus and Israel's faith in the One God and Saviour') - Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a claim as \"He who is not with me is against me\"; and his saying that there was in him \"something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than Solomon\", something \"greater than the Temple\"; his reminder that David had called the Messiah his Lord, and his affirmations, \"Before Abraham was, I AM\", and even \"I and the Father are one.\"  Got a Bible question?
