Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2615 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is united with that of Jesus is \"another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\" This new dimension of prayer and of its circumstances is displayed throughout the farewell discourse. In the Holy Spirit, Christian prayer is a communion of love with the Father, not only through Christ but also in him: \"Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.\" - 2815 (in 'Hallowed be thy name') - This petition embodies all the others. Like the six petitions that follow, it is fulfilled by the prayer of Christ. Prayer to our Father is our prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus (abbreviated). - 661 (in 'He Ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father') - This final stage stays closely linked to the first, that is, to his descent from heaven in the Incarnation. Only the one who \"came from the Father\" can return to the Father: Christ Jesus. \"No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man (abbreviated). - 2795 (in 'Who Art in Heaven') - Jn Christ, then, heaven and earth are reconciled, for the Son alone \"descended from heaven\" and causes us to ascend there with him, by his Cross, Resurrection, and Ascension (abbreviated).
