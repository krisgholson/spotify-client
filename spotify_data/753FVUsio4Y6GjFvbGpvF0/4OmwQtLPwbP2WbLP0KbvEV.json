Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 581 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi. He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the Law. Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people \"as one who had authority, and not as their scribes\". In Jesus, the same Word of God that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes. Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: \"You have heard that it was said to the men of old. . . But I say to you. . .\"With this same divine authority, he disavowed certain human traditions of the Pharisees that were \"making void the word of God\".  Got a Bible question?
