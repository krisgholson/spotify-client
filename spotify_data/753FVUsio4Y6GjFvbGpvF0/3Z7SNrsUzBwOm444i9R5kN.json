Behold your Mother.'  Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle to the cross; he experiences hunger, thirst and privation (abbreviated). - 607 (in 'Christ's whole life is an offering to the Father') - From the cross, just before \"It is finished\", he said, \"I thirst.\" (abbreviated). - 2561 (in 'What is Prayer?') - Prayer is the response of faith to the free promise of salvation and also a response of love to the thirst of the only Son of God (abbreviated). - 2605 (in 'Jesus Prays') - When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father's plan of love, Jesus allows a glimpse of the boundless depth of his filial prayer, not only before he freely delivered himself up (\u201cAbba . . . not my will, but yours.\"), but even in his last words on the Cross, where prayer and the gift of self are but one: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do\", \"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise\", \"Woman, behold your son\" - \"Behold your mother\", \"I thirst.\"; \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" \"It is finished\"; \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!\" until the \"loud cry\" as he expires, giving up his spirit. - 624 (in 'Jesus Christ was Buried') - \"By the grace of God\" Jesus tasted death \"for every one\". In his plan of salvation, God ordained that his Son should not only \"die for our sins\" but should also \"taste death\", experience the condition of death, the separation of his soul from his body, between the time he expired on the cross and the time he was raised from the dead. The state of the dead Christ is the mystery of the tomb and the descent into hell. It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the tomb, reveals God's great sabbath rest after the fulfilment of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe. - 730 (in 'Christ Jesus') - At last Jesus' hour arrives: he commends his spirit into the Father's hands at the very moment when by his death he conquers death, so that, \"raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,\" he might immediately give the Holy Spirit by \"breathing\" on his disciples (abbreviated). - 726 (in 'Rejoice you who are full of grace') - 2618 (in 'The Prayer of the Virgin Mary') - 501 (in 'Mary ever-virgin') - 964 (in 'Wholly united with her Son') - 2677-2679 (in 'In Communion with the Holy Mother of God') - 641 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - 478 (in 'The Heart of the Incarnate Word') - 694 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - 1225 (in 'Christ's Baptism')  Got a Bible question?
