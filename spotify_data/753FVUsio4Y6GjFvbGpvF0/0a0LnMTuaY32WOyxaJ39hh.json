Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 575 (in 'Jesus and Israel') - To be sure, Christ's relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical. Some Pharisees warn him of the danger he was courting; Jesus praises some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at their homes (abbreviated). - 588 (in 'Jesus and Israel's faith in the One God and Saviour') - Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and sinners as familiarly as with themselves. Against those among them \"who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others\", Jesus affirmed: \"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" He went further by proclaiming before the Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who pretend not to need salvation are blind to themselves. - 2616 (in 'Jesus hears our prayer') - Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection: Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good thief) or in silence (the bearers of the paralytic, the woman with a hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the tears and ointment of the sinful woman). - 1441 (in 'Only God Forgives Sin') - Only God forgives sins. Since he is the Son of God, Jesus says of himself, \"The Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" and exercises this divine power: \"Your sins are forgiven\" (abbreviated).
