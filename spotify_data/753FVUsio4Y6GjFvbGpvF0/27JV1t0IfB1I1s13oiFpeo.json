Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 645 (in 'The Condition of Christ's risen humanity') - By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion. Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine realm. For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith. - 448 (in 'Lord') - Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as \"Lord\". This title testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach him for help and healing. At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, \"Lord\" expresses the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus. In the encounter with the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration: \"My Lord and my God!\" It thus takes on a connotation of love and affection that remains proper to the Christian tradition: \"It is the Lord!\"  Got a Bible question?
