Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2232 (in 'The Family and the Kingdom') - Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child grows to maturity and human and spiritual autonomy, so his unique vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly and forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their children to follow it. They must be convinced that the first vocation of the Christian is to follow Jesus: \"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\" - 1506 (in 'Heal the Sick') - Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their cross in their turn (abbreviated). - 858 (in 'The Apostles' Mission') - Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry, he \"called to him those whom he desired; .... and he appointed twelve, whom also he named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach.\" From then on, they would also be his \"emissaries\" (Greek apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his own mission: \"As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\"The apostles' ministry is the continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: \"he who receives you receives me.\"  Got a Bible question?
