Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 545 (In 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: \u201cI came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\u201d He invites them to that conversion without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but shows them in word and deed his Father\u2019s boundless mercy for them and the vast \u201cjoy in heaven over one sinner who repents.\u201d The supreme proof of his love will be the sacrifice of his own life \u201cfor the forgiveness of sins.\u201d - 2839 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - But though we are clothed with the baptismal garment, we do not cease to sin, to turn away from God. Now, in this new petition, we return to him like the prodigal son and, like the tax collector, recognize that we are sinners before him (abbreviated) - 1700 (in 'The Dignity of the Human Person') - With the help of grace they grow in virtue (article 7), avoid sin, and if they sin they entrust themselves as did the prodigal son to the mercy of our Father in heaven (article 8). In this way they attain to the perfection of charity (abbreviated) - 1439 (in 'The Many Forms of Penance in the Christian Life') - The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus in the parable of the prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful father: The fascination of illusory freedom, the abandonment of the father's house; the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after squandering his fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself obliged to feed swine, and still worse, at wanting to feed on the husks the pigs ate; his reflection on all he has lost; his repentance and decision to declare himself guilty before his father; the journey back; the father's generous welcome; the father's joy - all these are characteristic of the process of conversion. the beautiful robe, the ring, and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life - pure worthy, and joyful - of anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of his family, which is the Church. Only the heart of Christ Who knows the depths of his Father's love could reveal to us the abyss of his mercy in so simple and beautiful a way. - 1423 (in 'What is this Sacrament called?') - It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in returning to the Father from whom one has strayed by sin (abbreviated) - 2795 (in 'Who Art in Heaven') - The symbol of the heavens refers us back to the mystery of the covenant we are living when we pray to our Father. He is in heaven, his dwelling place; the Father's house is our homeland. Sin has exiled us from the land of the covenant, but conversion of heart enables us to return to the Father, to heaven (abbreviated). - 1468 (in 'The Effects of the Sacrament of Reconciliation') - Indeed the sacrament of Reconciliation with God brings about a true \"spiritual resurrection,\" restoration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most precious is friendship with God (abbreviated).
