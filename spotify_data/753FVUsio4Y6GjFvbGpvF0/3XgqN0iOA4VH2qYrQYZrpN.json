Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 523 (in 'The Preparations') - St. John the Baptist is the Lord\u2019s immediate precursor or forerunner, sent to prepare his way. \u201cProphet of the Most High,\u201d John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last. He inaugurates the Gospel, already from his mother\u2019s womb welcomes the coming of Christ (abbreviated). - 1717 (in 'John, precursor, prophet and baptist') - \u201cThere was a man sent from God, whose name was John.\u201d John was \u201cfilled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother\u2019s womb\u201d by Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just conceived by the Holy Spirit. Mary\u2019s visitation to Elizabeth thus became a visit from God to his people. - 2676 & 2677 (in 'Communion with the Holy Mother of God') - Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. After the angel\u2019s greeting, we make Elizabeth\u2019s greeting our own. \u201cFilled with the Holy Spirit,\u201d Elizabeth is the first in the long succession of generations who have called Mary \u201cblessed.\u201d \u201cBlessed is she who believed. . . .\u201d Mary is \u201cblessed among women\u201d because she believed in the fulfillment of the Lord\u2019s word. Abraham, because of his faith, became a blessing for all the nations of the earth. Mary, because of her faith, became the mother of believers, through whom all nations of the earth receive him who is God\u2019s own blessing: Jesus, the \u201cfruit of thy womb.\u201d Holy Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, \u201cAnd why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\u201d (abbreviated) - 448 (in 'LORD') - At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, \u201cLord\u201d expresses the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus (abbreviated). - 495 (in 'Mary's Divine Motherhood') - Called in the Gospels \u201cthe mother of Jesus,\u201d Mary is acclaimed by Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before the birth of her son, as \u201cthe mother of my Lord.\u201d In fact, the One whom she conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son according to the flesh, was none other than the Father\u2019s eternal Son, the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the Church confesses that Mary is truly \u201cMother of God\u201d (Theotokos). - 148 (in 'Blessed is she who believed') - Elizabeth greeted her: \u201cBlessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\u201d It is for this faith that all generations have called Mary blessed (abbreviated).
