Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2731 (in 'Facing Difficulties in Prayer') - Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray, is dryness. Dryness belongs to contemplative prayer when the heart is separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, memories, and feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer faith clinging faithfully to Jesus in his agony and in his tomb. \"Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if dies, it bears much fruit.\" If dryness is due to the lack of roots, because the word has fallen on rocky soil, the battle requires conversion.
