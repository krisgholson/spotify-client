Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1034 (in 'Hell') - Jesus often speaks of \"Gehenna\" of \"the unquenchable fire\" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. Jesus solemnly proclaims that he \"will send his angels, and they will gather . . . all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,\" and that he will pronounce the condemnation: \"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!\" - 1117 (in 'The Sacraments of the Church') - As she has done for the canon of Sacred Scripture and for the doctrine of the faith, the Church, by the power of the Spirit who guides her \"into all truth,\" has gradually recognized this treasure received from Christ and, as the faithful steward of God's mysteries, has determined its \"dispensation.\" Thus the Church has discerned over the centuries that among liturgical celebrations there are seven that are, in the strict sense of the term, sacraments instituted by the Lord.
