Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 545 (In 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: \u201cI came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\u201d He invites them to that conversion without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but shows them in word and deed his Father\u2019s boundless mercy for them and the vast \u201cjoy in heaven over one sinner who repents.\u201d The supreme proof of his love will be the sacrifice of his own life \u201cfor the forgiveness of sins.\u201d - 589 (In 'Jesus & Israel's Faith in the One God & Saviour') - Jesus gave scandal above \u00a0all when he identified his merciful conduct toward sinners with God\u2019s own attitude toward them. He went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was admitting them to the messianic banquet (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
