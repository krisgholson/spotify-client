Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2053 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity. The evangelical counsels are inseparable from the Commandments (abbreviated). - 226 (in 'The Implications of Faith in One God') - It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us away from him: My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me from you. My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you. - 276 (in 'The Mystery of God's apparent powerlessness') - Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses her prayer to the \"almighty and eternal God\" (\u201comnipotens sempiterne Deus. . .\"), believing firmly that \"nothing will be impossible with God\" - 308 (in 'Providence and Secondary Causes') - Drawn from nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for \"without a Creator the creature vanishes.\" Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God's grace (abbreviated). - 1058 (in 'I Believe in Life Everlasting') - The Church prays that no one should be lost: \"Lord, let me never be parted from you.\" If it is true that no one can save himself, it is also true that God \"desires all men to be saved\" (1 Tim 2:4), and that for him \"all things are possible\" - 765 (in 'The Church - Instituted by Christ Jesus') - The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure that will remain until the Kingdom is fully achieved. Before all else there is the choice of the Twelve with Peter as their head. Representing the twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new Jerusalem (abbreviated).
