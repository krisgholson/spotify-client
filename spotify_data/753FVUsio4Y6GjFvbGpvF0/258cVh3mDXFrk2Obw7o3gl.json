Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2242 (in 'The Duties of Citizens') - The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their demands are contrary to those of an upright conscience, finds its justification in the distinction between serving God and serving the political community. \"Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" We must obey God rather than men.\"  Got a Bible question?
