Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 423 (in 'The Good News: God has sent his son') - We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the Great and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who died crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He 'came from God', 'descended from heaven', and 'came in the flesh'. For 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. . . and from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.' - 440 (in 'Christ') - Jesus unveiled the authentic content of his messianic kingship both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man \"who came down from heaven\", and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant: \"The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" Hence the true meaning of his kingship is revealed only when he is raised high on the cross (abbreviated). - 661 (in 'He Ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father') - This final stage stays closely linked to the first, that is, to his descent from heaven in the Incarnation. Only the one who \"came from the Father\" can return to the Father: Christ Jesus. \"No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.\" Left to its own natural powers humanity does not have access to the \"Father's house\", to God's life and happiness. Only Christ can open to man such access that we, his members, might have confidence that we too shall go where he, our Head and our Source, has preceded us. - 219 (in 'God is love') - God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his son. His love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her children. God loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be victorious over even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most precious gift: \"God so loved the world that he gave his only Son.\" - 458 (in 'Why did the Word become Flesh'?) - The Word became flesh so that thus we might know God's love: \"In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.\" \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\" - 678-679 (in 'To Judge the Living and the Dead') - Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus announced the judgement of the Last Day in his preaching. Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to light. Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of God's grace as nothing be condemned...Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive judgement on the works and hearts of men belongs to him as redeemer of the world. He \"acquired\" this right by his cross. the Father has given \"all judgement to the Son\". Yet the Son did not come to judge, but to save and to give the life he has in himself. By rejecting grace in this life, one already judges oneself, receives according to one's works, and can even condemn oneself for all eternity by rejecting the Spirit of love (abbreviated).
