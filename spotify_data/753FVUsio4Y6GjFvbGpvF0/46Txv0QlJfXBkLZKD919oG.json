Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2054 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the Spirit at work in their letter. He preached a \"righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees\" as well as that of the Gentiles. - 2262 (in 'The Fifth Commandment') - In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, \"You shall not kill,\" and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. - 2302 (in 'Peace') - By recalling the commandment, \"You shall not kill,\" our Lord asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and hatred as immoral. - 678 (in 'To Judge the Living and the Dead') - Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus announced the judgement of the Last Day in his preaching. Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to light. Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of God's grace as nothing be condemned. Our attitude to our neighbour will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and divine love. - 1034 (in 'Hell') - Jesus often speaks of \"Gehenna\" of \"the unquenchable fire\" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 2845 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine forgiveness, whether one speaks of \"sins\" as in Luke (11:4), \"debts\" as in Matthew (6:12). We are always debtors: \"Owe no one anything, except to love one another.\" - 1424 (in 'The Sacrament of Reconciliation') - It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the sinner the live of God who reconciles: \"Be reconciled to God.\" He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call: \"Go; first be reconciled to your brother.\"  Got a Bible question?
