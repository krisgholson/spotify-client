Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 454 (in 'The Only Son of God') - The title \u201cSon of God\u201d signifies the unique and eternal relationship of Jesus Christ to God his Father: he is the only Son of the Father (cf. Jn1:14,18; 3:16,18); he is God himself (cf. Jn1:1). To be a Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (cf. Acts 8:37; 1 Jn 2:23). - 2780 (in 'Father') - We can invoke God as \u201cFather\u201d because he is revealed to us by his Son become man and because his Spirit makes him known to us. The personal relation of the Son to the Father is something that man cannot conceive of nor the angelic powers even dimly see: and yet, the Spirit of the Son grants a participation in that very relation to us who believe that Jesus is the Christ and that we are born of God. - 1216 (in 'The Name of the Sacrament of Baptism') - \u201cThis bath is called enlightenment, because those who receive this [catechetical] instruction are enlightened in their understanding . . . .\u201d Having received in Baptism the Word, \u201cthe true light that enlightens every man,\u201d the person baptized has been \u201cenlightened,\u201d he becomes a \u201cson of light,\u201d indeed, he becomes \u201clight\u201d himself\" (abbreviated) - 1996 (in 'Grace') - Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life. - 423 (in 'The Good News: God has sent his Son') - We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the Great and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who died crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He \u201ccame from God,\u201d \u201cdescended from heaven,\u201d and \u201ccame in the flesh.\u201d For \u201cthe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. . . . And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.\u201d - 151 (in 'To Believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God') - For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his \u201cbeloved Son,\u201d in whom the Father is \u201cwell pleased\u201d; God tells us to listen to him. The Lord himself said to his disciples: \u201cBelieve in God, believe also in me.\u201d We can believe in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made flesh: \u201cNo one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.\u201d Because he \u201chas seen the Father,\u201d Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him. - 291 (in 'Creation-Work of the Holy Trinity') - 241 (in 'The Father revealed by the Son') - 612 (in 'The agony at Gethsemani') - 717 & 719 (in 'John, precursor, prophet and baptist') - 530 (in 'The Mysteries of Jesus' infancy') - 526 (in 'The Christmas Mystery') - 1692 (in 'Life in Christ') - 496 (in 'Mary's virginity' - 445 (in 'The Only Son of God') - 461 (in 'The Incarnation')  Got a Bible question?
