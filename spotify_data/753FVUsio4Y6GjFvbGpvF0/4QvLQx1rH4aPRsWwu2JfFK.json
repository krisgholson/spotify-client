Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 546 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus\u2019 invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of parables, a characteristic feature of his teaching. Through his parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything. Words are not enough; deeds are required. The parables are like mirrors for man: will he be hard soil or good earth for the word? What use has he made of the talents he has received? Jesus and the presence of the kingdom in this world are secretly at the heart of the parables. One must enter the kingdom, that is, become a disciple of Christ, in order to \u201cknow the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. \u201dFor those who stay \u201coutside,\u201d everything remains enigmatic.
