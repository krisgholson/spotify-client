Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2174 (in 'The Day of the Resurrection, the new Creation') - Jesus rose from the dead \"on the first day of the week.\" Because it is the \"first day,\" the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the first creation. Because it is the \"eighth day\" following the sabbath, it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday: We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead. - 640 (in 'The Empty Tomb') - \u201cWhy do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.\u201d The first element we encounter in the framework of the Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a direct proof of Resurrection; the absence of Christ\u2019s body from the tomb could be explained otherwise. Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case, first with the holy women, and then with Peter. The disciple \u201cwhom Jesus loved\u201d affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb and discovered \u201cthe linen cloths lying there,\u201d \u201che saw and believed.\u201d This suggests that he realized from the empty tomb\u2019s condition that the absence of Jesus\u2019 body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus. - 515 (in 'Christ's Whole Life is Mystery') - From the swaddling clothes of his birth to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, everything in Jesus\u2019 life was a sign of his mystery.
