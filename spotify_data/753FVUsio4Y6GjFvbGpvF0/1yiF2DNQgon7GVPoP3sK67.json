Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2746-2749 (in 'The Prayer of the Hour of Jesus') - When \"his hour\" came, Jesus prayed to the Father. His prayer, the longest transmitted by the Gospel, embraces the whole economy of creation and salvation, as well as his death and Resurrection. the prayer of the Hour of Jesus always remains his own, just as his Passover \"once for all\" remains ever present in the liturgy of his Church. Christian Tradition rightly calls this prayer the \"priestly\" prayer of Jesus. It is the prayer of our high priest, inseparable from his sacrifice, from his passing over (Passover) to the Father to whom he is wholly \"consecrated.\" In this Paschal and sacrificial prayer, everything is recapitulated in Christ: God and the world; the Word and the flesh; eternal life and time; the love that hands itself over and the sin that betrays it; the disciples present and those who will believe in him by their word; humiliation and glory. It is the prayer of unity. Jesus fulfilled the work of the Father completely; his prayer, like his sacrifice, extends until the end of time. the prayer of this hour fills the end-times and carries them toward their consummation. Jesus, the Son to whom the Father has given all things, has given himself wholly back to the Father, yet expresses himself with a sovereign freedom by virtue of the power the Father has given him over all flesh. the Son, who made himself Servant, is Lord, the Pantocrator. Our high priest who prays for us is also the one who prays in us and the God who hears our prayer. - 684 (in 'I Believe in the Holy Spirit') - Through his grace, the Holy Spirit is the first to awaken faith in us and to communicate to us the new life, which is to \"know the Father and the one whom he has sent, Jesus Christ\" (abbreviated). - 1721 (in 'Christian Beatitude') - God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him, and so to come to paradise. Beatitude makes us \"partakers of the divine nature\" and of eternal life. With beatitude, man enters into the glory of Christ and into the joy of the Trinitarian life. - 1069 (in 'What does the word 'liturgy' mean?') - Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high priest, continues the work of our redemption in, with, and through his Church (abbreviated). - 2812 (in 'Hallowed be thy name') - Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his word, and by his sacrifice. This is the heart of his priestly prayer: \"Holy Father . . . for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth.\" Because he \"sanctifies\" his own name, Jesus reveals to us the name of the Father. At the end of Christ's Passover, the Father gives him the name that is above all names: \"Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\" - 2765 (in 'the Lord's Prayer') - The traditional expression \"the Lord's Prayer\" - oratio Dominica - means that the prayer to our Father is taught and given to us by the Lord Jesus. the prayer that comes to us from Jesus is truly unique: it is \"of the Lord.\" On the one hand, in the words of this prayer the only Son gives us the words the Father gave him:1 he is the master of our prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he knows in his human heart the needs of his human brothers and sisters and reveals them to us: he is the model of our prayer.  Got a Bible question?
