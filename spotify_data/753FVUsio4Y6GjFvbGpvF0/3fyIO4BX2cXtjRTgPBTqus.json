Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 671 (In 'until all things are subjected to him') - Though already present in his Church, Christ\u2019s reign is nevertheless yet to be fulfilled \u201cwith power and great glory\u201d by the king\u2019s return to earth. This reign is still under attack by the evil powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ\u2019s Passover (abbreviated). - 697 (In 'symbols of the Holy Spirit') - Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on the day of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the day of his final coming (abbreviated). - 2612 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - In Jesus \"the Kingdom of God is at hand.\" He calls his hearers to conversion and faith, but also to watchfulness. In prayer the disciple keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who Comes, in memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the hope of his second coming in glory. In communion with their Master, the disciples' prayer is a battle; only by keeping watch in prayer can one avoid falling into temptation.  Got a Bible question?
