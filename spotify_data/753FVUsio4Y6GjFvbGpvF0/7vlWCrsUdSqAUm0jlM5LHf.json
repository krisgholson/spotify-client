Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 440 (In 'Christ') - Jesus accepted Peter\u2019s profession of faith, which acknowledged him to be the Messiah, by announcing the imminent Passion of the Son of Man. He unveiled the authentic content of his messianic kingship both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man \u201cwho came down from heaven,\u201d and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant: \u201cThe Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d Hence the true meaning of his kingship is revealed only when he is raised high on the cross. Only after his Resurrection will Peter be able to proclaim Jesus\u2019 messianic kingship to the People of God: \u201cLet all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\u201d - 2616 (In 'Jesus hears our prayer') - Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection: Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good thief) (abbreviated). - 1021 (In 'The Particular Judgement') - Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either accepting or rejecting the divine grace manifested in Christ. The New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the final encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeatedly affirms that each will be rewarded immediately after death in accordance with his works and faith. The parable of the poor man Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as well as other New Testament texts speak of a final destiny of the soul\u2014a destiny which can be different for some and for others. - 2266 (In 'Legitimate Defense') - The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to people\u2019s rights and to the basic rules of civil society correspond to the requirement of safeguarding the common good. Legitimate public authority has the right and the duty to inflict punishment proportionate to the gravity of the offense. Punishment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense. When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of expiation. Punishment then, in addition to defending public order and protecting people\u2019s safety, has a medicinal purpose: as far as possible, it must contribute to the correction of the guilty party.
