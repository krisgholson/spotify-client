Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 500 (in Mary 'Ever-Virgin') - Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus. The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, \u201cbrothers of Jesus,\u201d are the sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls \u201cthe other Mary.\u201d They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression. - 699 (in 'The Hand') - The hand. Jesus heals the sick and blesses little children by laying hands on them (abbreviated) - 2610 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') -Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before receiving his gifts, so he teaches us filial boldness: \u201cWhatever you ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will.\u201d Such is the power of prayer and of faith that does not doubt: \u201call things are possible to him who believes.\u201d Jesus is as saddened by the \u201clack of faith\u201d of his own neighbors and the \u201clittle faith\u201d of his own disciples as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the Canaanite woman.
