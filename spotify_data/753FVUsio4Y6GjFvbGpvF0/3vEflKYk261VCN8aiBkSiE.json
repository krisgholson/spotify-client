Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to light. Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of God's grace as nothing be condemned. Our attitude to our neighbour will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and divine love. On the Last Day Jesus will say: \"Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.\" - 2444 (in 'Love for the Poor') - \"The Church's love for the poor . . . is a part of her constant tradition.\" This love is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of the poverty of Jesus, and of his concern for the poor. Love for the poor is even one of the motives for the duty of working so as to \"be able to give to those in need\" (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
