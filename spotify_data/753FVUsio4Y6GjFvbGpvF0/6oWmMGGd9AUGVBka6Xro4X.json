Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 58 (in 'The Covenant with Noah') - The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel (abbreviated). - 674 (In 'The glorious advent of Christ, the hope of Israel) - The glorious Messiah\u2019s coming is suspended at every moment of history until his recognition by \u201call Israel,\u201d for \u201ca hardening has come upon part of Israel\u201d in their \u201cunbelief\u201d toward Jesus. St. Peter says to the Jews of Jerusalem after Pentecost: \u201cRepent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old.\u201d St. Paul echoes him: \u201cFor if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?\u201d The \u201cfull inclusion\u201d of the Jews in the Messiah\u2019s salvation, in the wake of \u201cthe full number of the Gentiles,\u201d will enable the People of God to achieve \u201cthe measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,\u201d in which \u201cGod may be all in all.\u201d - 671 (In 'until all things are subjected to him') - Though already present in his Church, Christ\u2019s reign is nevertheless yet to be fulfilled \u201cwith power and great glory\u201d by the king\u2019s return to earth. This reign is still under attack by the evil powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ\u2019s Passover (abbreviated). - 697 (In 'symbols of the Holy Spirit') - Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on the day of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the day of his final coming (abbreviated).
