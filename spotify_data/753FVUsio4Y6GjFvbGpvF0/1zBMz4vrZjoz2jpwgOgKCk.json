Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 644 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are still doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were seeing a ghost. \"In their joy they were still disbelieving and still wondering.\" Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and St. Matthew relates that during the risen Lord's last appearance in Galilee \"some doubted.\" Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up (abbreviated). - 645 (in 'The Condition of Christ's risen humanity') - By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion. Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine realm (abbreviated). - 448 (in 'Lord') - In the encounter with the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration: \"My Lord and my God!\" It thus takes on a connotation of love and affection that remains proper to the Christian tradition: \"It is the Lord!\" (abbreviated).
