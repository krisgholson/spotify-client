Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 459 (in 'Why did the Word become Flesh') - The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: \u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn from me.\u201d \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me\" (abbreviated) - 1658 (in 'The Domestic Church') - The doors of homes, the \u201cdomestic churches,\u201d and of the great family which is the Church must be open to all of them. \u201cNo one is without a family in this world: the Church is a home and family for everyone, especially those who \u2018labor and are heavy laden.\u2019\u201d(abbreviated) - 1615 (in 'Marriage in the Lord') - This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy\u2014heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to \u201creceive\u201d the original meaning of marriage and live it with the help of Christ. This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit of Christ\u2019s cross, the source of all Christian life (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
