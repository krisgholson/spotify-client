Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 546 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus' invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of parables, a characteristic feature of his teaching. Through his parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything. Words are not enough, deeds are required (abbreviated). - 535 (in 'The Baptism of Jesus') - Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches \"a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins\". A crowd of sinners - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by him (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
