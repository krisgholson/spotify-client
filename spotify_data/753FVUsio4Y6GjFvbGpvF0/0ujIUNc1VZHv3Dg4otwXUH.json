Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 450 (in 'Lord') - From the beginning of Christian history, the assertion of Christ's lordship over the world and over history has implicitly recognized that man should not submit his personal freedom in an absolute manner to any earthly power, but only to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Caesar is not \"the Lord\". \"The Church. . . believes that the key, the centre and the purpose of the whole of man's history is to be found in its Lord and Master.\" - \"The principle Jesus enunciates here forms part of the basis of Catholic teaching on the relationship of Church and state. Other New Testament writings elaborate on Jesus\u2019 principle, affirming both our duty to respect civil authority (Rom 13:1\u20137; 1 Tim 2:1\u20136; Titus 3:1\u20132; 1 Pet 2:13\u201317) and our overriding allegiance to God wherever civil authority oversteps its bounds or imposes laws contrary to the moral law (Acts 5:29; Rev 13:1\u201318). The Catechism articulates this balanced understanding. \u201cThose subject to authority should regard those in authority as representatives of God\u201d (2238); \u201cSubmission to authority and co-responsibility for the common good make it morally obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the right to vote, and to defend one\u2019s country\u201d (2240). However, \u201cThe citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the Gospel\u201d (2242).\" - The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture: Mark.
