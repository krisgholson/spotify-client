Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 474 (in 'Christ's Soul and his human knowledge') - By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveal. What he admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere declared himself not sent to reveal. - 673 (in 'The glorious advent of Christ, the hope of Israel') - Since the Ascension Christ's coming in glory has been Imminent, even though \"it is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. This eschatological coming could be accomplished at any moment, even if both it and the final trial that will precede it are \"delayed\". - 2612 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - In Jesus \"the Kingdom of God is at hand.\" He calls his hearers to conversion and faith, but also to watchfulness. In prayer the disciple keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who Comes, in memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the hope of his second coming in glory. In communion with their Master, the disciples' prayer is a battle; only by keeping watch in prayer can one avoid falling into temptation.\"  Got a Bible question?
