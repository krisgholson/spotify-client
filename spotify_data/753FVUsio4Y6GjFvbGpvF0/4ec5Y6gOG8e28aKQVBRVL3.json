Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1430 (in 'Interior Penance') - Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, \"sackcloth and ashes,\" fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance. - 1969 (in 'The New Law') - The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer and fasting, directing them to the \"Father who sees in secret,\" in contrast with the desire to \"be seen by men.\" Its prayer is the Our Father. - 1753 (in 'The Sources of Morality') - A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor) does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying and calumny, good or just. the end does not justify the means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving). - 2447 (in 'Love for the Poor') - The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. the corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead. Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to God. - 1063 (in 'Amen') - Our Lord often used the word \"Amen,\" sometimes repeated, to emphasize the trustworthiness of his teaching, his authority founded on God's truth (abbreviated) - 1693 (in 'Life in Christ') - Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father, and always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father \"who sees in secret,\" in order to become \"perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.\" - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 2655 (in 'The Liturgy of the Church') - Even when it is lived out \"in secret,\" prayer is always prayer of the Church; it is a communion with the Holy Trinity. - 2691 (in 'Places favourable for prayer') - For personal prayer, this can be a 'prayer corner' with the Sacred Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our Father.
