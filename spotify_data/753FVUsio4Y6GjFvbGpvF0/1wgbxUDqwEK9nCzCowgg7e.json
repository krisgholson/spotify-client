Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2412 (In 'Respect for the Goods of Others') - In virtue of commutative justice, reparation for injustice committed requires the restitution of stolen goods to their owner: Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: \u201cIf I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.\u201d Those who, directly or indirectly, have taken possession of the goods of another, are obliged to make restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money, if the goods have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their owner would have legitimately obtained from them. Likewise, all who in some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly benefited from it\u2014for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or received the stolen goods\u2014are obliged to make restitution in proportion to their responsibility and to their share of what was stolen. - 588 (In 'Jesus & The Temple') - Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and sinners as familiarly as with themselves. Against those among them \u201cwho trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others,\u201d Jesus affirmed: \u201cI have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d(abbreviated) - 549 (In 'The Signs of the Kingdom of God') - By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger, injustice, illness, and death, Jesus performed messianic signs. Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below, but to free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their vocation as God\u2019s sons and causes all forms of human bondage. - 2712 (In 'Contemplative Prayer') - Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.\u201d (abbreviated)  Got a Bible question?
