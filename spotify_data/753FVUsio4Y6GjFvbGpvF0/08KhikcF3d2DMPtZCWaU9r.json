Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 994 (in 'The Progressive revelation of the Resurrection') - Already now in this present life he gives a sign and pledge of this by restoring some of the dead to life, announcing thereby his own Resurrection, though it was to be of another order (abbreviated). - 1503 (in 'Christ the Physician') - Christ's compassion toward the sick and his many healings of every kind of infirmity are a resplendent sign that \"God has visited his people\" and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand. Jesus has the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins; he has come to heal the whole man, soul and body; he is the physician the sick have need of. His compassion toward all who suffer goes so far that he identifies himself with them: \"I was sick and you visited me.\" His preferential love for the sick has not ceased through the centuries to draw the very special attention of Christians toward all those who suffer in body and soul. It is the source of tireless efforts to comfort them.  Got a Bible question?
