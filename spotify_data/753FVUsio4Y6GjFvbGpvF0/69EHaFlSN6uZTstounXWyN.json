Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2287 (In 'Scandal') - Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. \u201cTemptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come!\u201d - 2845 (In 'As we forgive those who trespass against us') - There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine forgiveness, whether one speaks of \u201csins\u201d as in Luke (11:4), or \u201cdebts\u201d as in Matthew (6:12). We are always debtors: \u201cOwe no one anything, except to love one another.\u201d (abbreviated) - 2227 (In 'The Duties of Parents) - Children in turn contribute to the growth in holiness of their parents. Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect. Mutual affection suggests this. The charity of Christ demands it. - 162 (In 'Perseverance in Faith) - Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can lose this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated to St. Timothy: \u201cWage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith.\u201d To live, grow, and persevere in the faith until the end we must nourish it with the word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase our faith; it must be \u201cworking through charity,\u201d abounding in hope, and rooted in the faith of the Church.
