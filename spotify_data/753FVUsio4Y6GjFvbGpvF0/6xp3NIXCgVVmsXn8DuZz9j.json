Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 728 (in 'Christ Jesus') - He also alludes to the Spirit in speaking to Nicodemus, to the Samaritan woman, and to those who take part in the feast of Tabernacles. To his disciples he speaks openly of the Spirit in connection with prayer and with the witness they will have to bear. - 161 (in 'The Necessity of Faith') - Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation. \u201cSince \u2018without faith it is impossible to please [God]\u2019 and to attain to the fellowship of his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification, nor will anyone obtain eternal life \u2018but he who endures to the end.\u2019\u201d - 1821 (in 'Hope') - We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to those who love him and do his will. In every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere \u201cto the end\u201d and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God\u2019s eternal reward for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ (abbreviated).
