Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 529 (in 'The mysteries of Jesus' infancy') - The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the firstborn Son who belongs to the Lord. With Simeon and Anna, all Israel awaits its encounter with the Savior\u2014the name given to this event in the Byzantine tradition. Jesus is recognized as the long-expected Messiah, the \u201clight to the nations\u201d and the \u201cglory of Israel,\u201d but also \u201ca sign that is spoken against.\u201d The sword of sorrow predicted for Mary announces Christ\u2019s perfect and unique oblation on the cross that will impart the salvation God had \u201cprepared in the presence of all peoples.\u201d - 583 (in 'Jesus and the temple') - Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary presented him forty days after his birth (abbreviated) - 711 (in 'Expectation of the Messiah and his spirit') - \u201cBehold, I am doing a new thing.\u201d Two prophetic lines were to develop, one leading to the expectation of the Messiah, the other pointing to the announcement of a new Spirit. They converge in the small Remnant, the people of the poor, who await in hope the \u201cconsolation of Israel\u201d and \u201cthe redemption of Jerusalem.\u201d - 713 (in 'Expectation of the Messiah and his spirit') - The Messiah\u2019s characteristics are revealed above all in the \u201cServant songs\" (abbreviated) - 695 (in 'Anointing') - The Virgin Mary conceived Christ by the Holy Spirit who, through the angel, proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come to the temple to see the Christ of the Lord (abbreviated) - 575 (in 'Jesus and Israel') - Many of Jesus\u2019 deeds and words constituted a \u201csign of contradiction,\u201d (abbreviated) - 587 (in 'Jesus and Israel's faith in the One God and Saviour') - If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of opposition to Jesus by Israel\u2019s religious authorities, his role in the redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true stumbling-block for them. - 149 (in 'Mary - blessed is she who believed') - Throughout her life and until her last ordeal when Jesus her son died on the cross, Mary\u2019s faith never wavered. She never ceased to believe in the fulfillment of God\u2019s word. And so the Church venerates in Mary the purest realization of faith. - 618 (in 'Our participation in Christ's sacrifice') - In fact Jesus desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be its first beneficiaries. This is achieved supremely in the case of his mother, who was associated more intimately than any other person in the mystery of his redemptive suffering (abbreviated)  Got a Bible question?
