Note: Some countries may have a different gospel reading at Mass today, if they celebrated the Feast of the Epiphany on Sunday rather than Monday. This podcast follows the lectionary for the General Roman Calendar.   Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1989 (in 'Justification') - The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion, effecting justification in accordance with Jesus\u2019 proclamation at the beginning of the Gospel: \u201cRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high. \u201cJustification is not only the remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man.\u201d - 1503 (in 'Christ the Physician') - Christ\u2019s compassion toward the sick and his many healings of every kind of infirmity are a resplendent sign that \u201cGod has visited his people\u201d and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand. Jesus has the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins; he has come to heal the whole man, soul and body; he is the physician the sick have need of (abbreviated). - 1720 (in 'Christian Beatitude') - The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the beatitude to which God calls man: \u2014 the coming of the Kingdom of God; \u2014 the vision of God: \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\u201d; \u2014 entering into the joy of the Lord; \u2014 entering into God\u2019s rest (abbreviated).
