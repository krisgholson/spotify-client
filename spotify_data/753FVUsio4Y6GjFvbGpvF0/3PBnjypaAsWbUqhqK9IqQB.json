Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 764 (in 'The Church - instituted by Jesus Christ') - \"This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the works and in the presence of Christ.\" To welcome Jesus' word is to welcome \"the Kingdom itself.\" The seed and beginning of the Kingdom are the \"little flock\" of those whom Jesus came to gather around him, the flock whose shepherd he is. They form Jesus' true family. To those whom he thus gathered around him, he taught a new \"way of acting\" and a prayer of their own. - 2849 (in 'And lead us not into temptation') - The Holy Spirit constantly seeks to awaken us to keep watch. Finally, this petition takes on all its dramatic meaning in relation to the last temptation of our earthly battle; it asks for final perseverance. \"Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake\" (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
