Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 74 (in 'The Transmission of Divine Revelation') - God \"desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth: that is, of Christ Jesus Christ must be proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this revelation may reach to the ends of the earth. - 459 (in 'Why did the Word become Flesh?') - The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me.\" \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me\" (abbreviated). - 1698 (in 'Life in Christ') - The first and last point of reference of this catechesis will always be Jesus Christ himself, who is \"the way, and the truth, and the life\" (abbreviated). - 2466 (in 'Living in the Truth') - In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made manifest. \"Full of grace and truth,\" he came as the \"light of the world,\" he is the Truth. \"Whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.\" The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know \"the truth [that] will make you free\" and that sanctifies (abbreviated). - 2614 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be, once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is new is to \"ask in his name.\" Faith in the Son introduces the disciples into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is \"the way, and the truth, and the life.\" - 470 (in 'How is the Son of God Man?') - The Son of God therefore communicates to his humanity his own personal mode of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body, Christ thus expresses humanly the divine ways of the Trinity. - 516 (in 'Characteristics common to Jesus' ministry') - Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of the Father. Jesus can say: \"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father\", and the Father can say: \"This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!\" Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father's will, even the least characteristics of his mysteries manifest \"God's love. . . among us\". - 2614 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be, once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is new is to \"ask in his name.\" Faith in the Son introduces the disciples into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is \"the way, and the truth, and the life\" (abbreviated). - 2633 (in 'Prayer of Petition') - When we share in God's saving love, we understand that every need can become the object of petition. Christ, who assumed all things in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name (abbreviated). - 2815 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - Prayer to our Father is our prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus (abbreviated).
