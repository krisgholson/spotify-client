Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 439 (In 'Christ') - Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messianic \u201cSon of David,\u201d promised by God to Israel. Jesus accepted his rightful title of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by some of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially political. - 2616 (In 'Jesus hears our prayer') - Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection: Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good thief) or in silence (the bearers of the paralytic, the woman with a hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the tears and ointment of the sinful woman). The urgent request of the blind men, \u201cHave mercy on us, Son of David\u201d or \u201cJesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\u201d has been renewed in the traditional prayer to Jesus known as the Jesus Prayer: \u201cLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner!\u201d Healing infirmities or forgiving sins, Jesus always responds to a prayer offered in faith: \u201cYour faith has made you well; go in peace.\u201d  Got a Bible question?
