Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2835 (in 'Give us this day our daily bread') - This petition, with the responsibility it involves, also applies to another hunger from which men are perishing: \"Man does not live by bread alone, but . . . by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God,\" that is, by the Word he speaks and the Spirit he breathes forth. Christians must make every effort \"to proclaim the good news to the poor.\" There is a famine on earth, \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.\" For this reason the specifically Christian sense of this fourth petition concerns the Bread of Life: the Word of God accepted in faith, the Body of Christ received in the Eucharist. - 698 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - The seal is a symbol close to that of anointing. \"The Father has set his seal\" on Christ and also seals us in him. Because this seal indicates the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image of the seal (sphragis) has been used in some theological traditions to express the indelible \"character\" imprinted by these three unrepeatable sacraments. - 1296 (in 'The Rite of Confirmation') - Christ himself declared that he was marked with his Father's seal. Christians are also marked with a seal: \"It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\" This seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our enrollment in his service for ever, as well as the promise of divine protection in the great eschatological trial. - 1094 (in 'The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ') - It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal catechesis of the Lord is built, and then, that of the Apostles and the Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called \"typological\" because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of the \"figures\" (types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth, starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled. Thus the flood and Noah's ark prefigured salvation by Baptism, as did the cloud and the crossing of the Red Sea. Water from the rock was the figure of the spiritual gifts of Christ, and manna in the desert prefigured the Eucharist, \"the true bread from heaven.\" - 423 (in 'The Good News: God has sent his Son') - We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the Great and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who died crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He 'came from God', 'descended from heaven', and 'came in the flesh'. For 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. . . and from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.' - 728 (in 'Christ Jesus')  Got a Bible question?
