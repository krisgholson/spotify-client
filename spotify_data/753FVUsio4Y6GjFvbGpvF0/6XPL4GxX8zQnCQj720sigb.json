Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 497 (in 'Mary's Virginity') - The gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus as a divine work that surpasses all human understanding and possibility: \u201cThat which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,\u201d said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fianc\u00e9e. The Church sees here the fulfillment of the divine promise given through the prophet Isaiah: \u201cBehold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\u201d - 333 (in 'Christ with all his angels') - They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been (abbreviated) - 437 (in 'Christ') - God called Joseph to \u201ctake Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,\u201d so that Jesus, \u201cwho is called Christ,\u201d should be born of Joseph\u2019s spouse into the messianic lineage of David (abbreviated) - 486 (in 'Who was Conceived by the Holy Spirit') - The Father\u2019s only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the Virgin Mary, is \u201cChrist,\u201d that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, from the beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples (abbreviated) - 430 (in 'Jesus') - Jesus means in Hebrew: \u201cGod saves\" (abbreviated) - 452 (in 'The Only Son of God') - The name Jesus means \u201cGod saves.\u201d The child born of the Virgin Mary is called Jesus, \u201cfor he will save his people from their sins\u201d (Mt 1:21): \u201cthere is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). - 1507 (in 'Heal the Sick') - The risen Lord renews this mission (\u201cIn my name . . . they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\u201d and confirms it through the signs that the Church performs by invoking his name. These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is truly \u201cGod who saves.\u201d - 1846 (in 'Mercy and Sin') - The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God\u2019s mercy to sinners. The angel announced to Joseph: \u201cYou shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins\" (abbreviated) - 2666 (in 'Prayer to Jesus') - But the one name that contains everything is the one that the Son of God received in his incarnation: Jesus. The divine name may not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our humanity. The Word of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: \u201cJesus,\u201d \u201cYHWH saves\" (abbreviated) - 2812 (in 'Hallowed be Thy Name') - Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his word, and by his sacrifice (abbreviated) - 744 (in 'The Spirit & the Church in the Last Days') - In the fullness of time the Holy Spirit completes in Mary all the preparations for Christ\u2019s coming among the People of God. By the action of the Holy Spirit in her, the Father gives the world Emmanuel, \u201cGodwith-us\u201d (Mt 1:23).  Got a Bible question?
