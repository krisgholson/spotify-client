Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 575 (in 'Jesus and Israel') - Many of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a \"sign of contradiction\", but more so for the religious authorities in Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply \"the Jews\", than for the ordinary People of God (abbreviated). - 595 (in 'Divisions amongst the Jewish authorities concerning Jesus') - Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the Pharisee Nicodemus and the prominent Joseph of Arimathea both secret disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing dissension about him, so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the very eve of Christ's Passion, \"many.. . believed in him\", though very imperfectly (abbreviated).
