Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 547 (in 'The Signs of the Kingdom of God') - Jesus accompanies his words with many \"mighty works and wonders and signs\", which manifest that the kingdom is present in him and attest that he was the promised Messiah. - 453 (in 'And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord') - The title \"Christ\" means \"Anointed One\" (Messiah) .Jesus is the Christ, for \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power\" (Acts 10:38). He was the one \"who is to come\" (Lk 7:19), the object of \"the hope of Israel\" (Acts 28:20). - 544 (in 'The Kingdom of God is at hand') - The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to \"preach good news to the poor\"; he declares them blessed, for \"theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
