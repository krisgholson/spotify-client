Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 89 (in 'the Magisterium of the Church') - There is an organic connection between our spiritual life and the dogmas. Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they illuminate it and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright, our intellect and heart will be open to welcome the light shed by the dogmas of faith. - 1741 (in 'Human Freedom in the Economy of Salvation') - Liberation and salvation. By his glorious Cross Christ has won salvation for all men. He redeemed them from the sin that held them in bondage. \"For freedom Christ has set us free.\" In him we have communion with the \"truth that makes us free.\" The Holy Spirit has been given to us and, as the Apostle teaches, \"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\" Already we glory in the \"liberty of the children of God.\" - 2466 (in 'Living in the Truth') - The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know \"the truth [that] will make you free\" and that sanctifies. To follow Jesus is to live in \"the Spirit of truth,\" whom the Father sends in his name and who leads \"into all the truth.\" To his disciples Jesus teaches the unconditional love of truth: \"Let what you say be simply 'Yes or No.'\" (abbreviated).2466 (in 'Living in the Truth') - The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know \"the truth [that] will make you free\" and that sanctifies.

Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below, but to free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their vocation as God's sons and causes all forms of human bondage. - 601 (in 'He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures') - The Scriptures had foretold this divine plan of salvation through the putting to death of \"the righteous one, my Servant\" as a mystery of universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that would free men from the slavery of sin (abbreviated).
