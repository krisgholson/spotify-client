Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 495 (in 'Mary's divine Motherhood') - Called in the Gospels \"the mother of Jesus\", Mary is acclaimed by Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before the birth of her son, as \"the mother of my Lord\" (abbreviated). - 500 (in Mary 'Ever-Virgin') - Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus. The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, \u201cbrothers of Jesus,\u201d are the sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls \u201cthe other Mary.\u201d They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression.
