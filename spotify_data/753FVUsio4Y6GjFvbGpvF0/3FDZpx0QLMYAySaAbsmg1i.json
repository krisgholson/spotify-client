Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 765 (in 'The Church - instituted by Jesus Christ') - The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ\u2019s mission and his power, but also in his lot. By all his actions, Christ prepares and builds his Church (abbreviated) - 1673 (in 'Various forms of sacramentals') - When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called exorcism. Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing (abbreviated) - 1506 (in 'Heal the Sick') - Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their cross in their turn. By following him they acquire a new outlook on illness and the sick. Jesus associates them with his own life of poverty and service. He makes them share in his ministry of compassion and healing: \u201cSo they went out and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.\u201d - 1511 (in 'A sacrament of the sick') - The Church believes and confesses that among the seven sacraments there is one especially intended to strengthen those who are being tried by illness, the Anointing of the Sick: \"This sacred anointing of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord as a true and proper sacrament of the New Testament. It is alluded to indeed by Mark, but is recommended to the faithful and promulgated by James the apostle and brother of the Lord.\"  Got a Bible question?
