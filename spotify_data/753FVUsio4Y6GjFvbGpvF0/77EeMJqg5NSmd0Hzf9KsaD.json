Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2611 (In 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - The prayer of faith consists not only in saying \u201cLord, Lord,\u201d but in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father. Jesus calls his disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for cooperating with the divine plan. - 543 (In 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced to the children of Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of all nations (abbreviated). - 1509 (In 'Heal the Sick') - \u201cHeal the sick!\u201d The Church has received this charge from the Lord and strives to carry it out by taking care of the sick as well as by accompanying them with her prayer of intercession. She believes in the life-giving presence of Christ, the physician of souls and bodies (abbreviated). - 2121 (In 'Irreligion') - Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things. To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: \u201cYour silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God\u2019s gift with money!\u201d Peter thus held to the words of Jesus: \u201cYou received without pay, give without pay.\u201d It is impossible to appropriate to oneself spiritual goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they have their source in God. One can receive them only from him, without payment. - 2443 (In 'Love for the Poor') - God blesses those who come to the aid of the poor and rebukes those who turn away from them: \u201cGive to him who begs from you, do not refuse him who would borrow from you\u201d; \u201cyou received without pay, give without pay\" (abbreviated)  Got a Bible question?
