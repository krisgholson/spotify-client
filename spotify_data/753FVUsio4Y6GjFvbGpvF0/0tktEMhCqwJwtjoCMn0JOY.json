Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1108 (in 'The Communion of the Holy Spirit') - In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. the Holy Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its branches. The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the Church is achieved in the liturgy. the Spirit who is the Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the liturgy. - 755 (in 'Symbols of the Church') - The Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about and will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has been planted by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who gives life and fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through the Church remain in Christ, without whom we can do nothing. - 1988 (in 'Justification') - Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in Christ's Passion by dying to sin, and in his Resurrection by being born to a new life; we are members of his Body which is the Church, branches grafted onto the vine which is himself: (God) gave himself to us through his Spirit. By the participation of the Spirit, we become communicants in the divine nature.... For this reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells are divinized. - 787 (in 'The Church is communion with Jesus') - Jesus spoke of a still more intimate communion between him and those who would follow him: \"Abide in me, and I in you.... I am the vine, you are the branches.\" and he proclaimed a mysterious and real communion between his own body and ours: \"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him\" (abbreviated). - 308 (in 'Providence and Secondary Causes') - The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the first cause who operates in and through secondary causes: \"For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\" Far from diminishing the creature's dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for \"without a Creator the creature vanishes.\" Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God's grace. - 864 (in 'The Apostolate') - \"Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church's whole apostolate\"; thus the fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained ministers as well as for lay people clearly depends on their vital union with Christ (abbreviated). - 1694 (in 'Life in Christ') - 2074 (in 'The Decalogue and the Natural Law') - 2732 (in 'Facing Temptations in Prayer') - 517 (in 'Characteristics common to Jesus' mysteries') - 737 (in 'The Holy Spirit and the Church') - 859 (in 'The Apostle's Mission')  Got a Bible question?
