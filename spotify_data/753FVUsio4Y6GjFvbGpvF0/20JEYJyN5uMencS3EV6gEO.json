Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1970 (In 'The New Law or the Law of the Gospel') - The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice between \u201cthe two ways\u201d and to put into practice the words of the Lord. It is summed up in the Golden Rule, \u201cWhatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the prophets.\u201d - 1821 (In 'Hope') - We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to those who love him and do his will. In every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere \u201cto the end\u201d and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God\u2019s eternal reward for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ (abbreviated). - 2611 (In 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - The prayer of faith consists not only in saying \u201cLord, Lord,\u201d but in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father (abbreviated). - 2826 (In 'Thy Will Be done on Earth as it is in Heaven') - By prayer we can discern \u201cwhat is the will of God\u201d and obtain the endurance to do it. Jesus teaches us that one enters the kingdom of heaven not by speaking words, but by doing \u201cthe will of my Father in heaven.\u201d  Got a Bible question?
