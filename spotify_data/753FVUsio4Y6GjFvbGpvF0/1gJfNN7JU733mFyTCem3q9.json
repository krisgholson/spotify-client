Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 534 (in 'The Mysteries of Jesus' Hidden Life') - The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the silence of the Gospels about the hidden years of Jesus. Here Jesus lets us catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total consecration to a mission that flows from his divine sonship: \"Did you not know that I must be about my Father's work?\" Mary and Joseph did not understand these words, but they accepted them in faith. Mary \"kept all these things in her heart\" during the years Jesus remained hidden in the silence of an ordinary life. - 583 (in 'Jesus and the temple') - Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary presented him forty days after his birth At the age of twelve he decided to remain in the Temple to remind his parents that he must be about his Father's business (abbreviated). - 503 (in 'Mary's Virginal Motherhood in God's Plan') - Mary's virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the Incarnation. Jesus has only God as Father. \"He was never estranged from the Father because of the human nature which he assumed. . . He is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his mother as to his humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both natures.\" - 2599 (in 'Jesus Prays') - He learns to pray in the words and rhythms of the prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer springs from an otherwise secret source, as he intimates at the age of twelve: \"I must be in my Father's house.\" Here the newness of prayer in the fullness of time begins to be revealed: his filial prayer, which the Father awaits from his children, is finally going to be lived out by the only Son in his humanity, with and for men (abbreviated). - 531 (in 'The Mysteries of Jesus' Hidden Life') - During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the vast majority of human beings: a daily life spent without evident greatness, a life of manual labour. His religious life was that of a Jew obedient to the law of God, a life in the community. From this whole period it is revealed to us that Jesus was \"obedient\" to his parents and that he \"increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man.\"  Got a Bible question?
