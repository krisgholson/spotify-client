Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 504 (in 'Mary's virginal motherhood in God's plan') - Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: \"The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.\" From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for God \"gives him the Spirit without measure.\" From \"his fullness\" as the head of redeemed humanity \"we have all received, grace upon grace.\" - 690 (in 'The Joint Mission of the Son and the Spirit') - Jesus is Christ, \"anointed,\" because the Spirit is his anointing, and everything that occurs from the Incarnation on derives from this fullness...The notion of anointing suggests . . . that there is no distance between the Son and the Spirit. Indeed, just as between the surface of the body and the anointing with oil neither reason nor sensation recognizes any intermediary, so the contact of the Son with the Spirit is immediate, so that anyone who would make contact with the Son by faith must first encounter the oil by contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered by the Holy Spirit. That is why the confession of the Son's Lordship is made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive him, the Spirit coming from all sides to those who approach the Son in faith (abbreviated). - 1286 (in 'Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation') - He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; his whole life and his whole mission are carried out in total communion with the Holy Spirit whom the Father gives him \"without measure.\" (abbreviated). - 161 (in 'The Necessity of Faith') - Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation. \"Since \"without faith it is impossible to please (God) \" and to attain to the fellowship of his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification, nor will anyone obtain eternal life 'But he who endures to the end.'\"  Got a Bible question?
