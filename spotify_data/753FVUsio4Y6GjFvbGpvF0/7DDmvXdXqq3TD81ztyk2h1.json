Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 526 (in 'The Christmas Mystery') - To become a child in relation to God is the condition for entering the kingdom. For this, we must humble ourselves and become little. Even more: to become \"children of God\" we must be \"born from above\" or \"born of God\" (abbreviated). - 2785 (in 'Our Father who art in Heaven') - Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us \"to turn and become like children\": for it is to \"little children\" that the Father is revealed (abbreviated). - 329 (in 'Who are the Angels') - With their whole beings the angels are servants and messengers of God. Because they \"always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven\" they are the \"mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word\" (abbreviated). - 336 (in 'The Angels in the Life of the Church') - From the beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their watchful care and intercession. \"Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life.\" Already here on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of angels and men united in God.
