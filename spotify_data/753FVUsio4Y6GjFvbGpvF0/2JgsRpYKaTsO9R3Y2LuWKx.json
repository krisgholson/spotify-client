He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d Already he is anticipating the \u201cbaptism\u201d of his bloody death. Already he is coming to \u201cfulfill all righteousness,\u201d that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father\u2019s will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father\u2019s voice responds to the Son\u2019s acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to \u201crest on him.\u201d Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind.

Christ\u2019s whole life expresses his mission: \u201cto serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.\u201d - 613 (in 'Christ's death is the unique and definitive sacrifice') - Christ\u2019s death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes the definitive redemption of men, through \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world\" (abbreviated) - 719 (in 'John, Precursor, Prophet & Baptist') - In John\u2019s sight, the Spirit thus brings to completion the careful search of the prophets and fulfills the longing of the angels. \u201cHe on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God. . . .
