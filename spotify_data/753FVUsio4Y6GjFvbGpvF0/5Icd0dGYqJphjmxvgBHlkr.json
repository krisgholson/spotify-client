Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 557 (in 'Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem') - \u201cWhen the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus] set his face to go to Jerusalem.\u201d By this decision he indicated that he was going up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times he had announced his Passion and Resurrection (abbreviated) - 474 (in 'Christ's Soul and his human knowledge') - By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveal (abbreviated) - 572 (in 'Jesus Christ Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, Died and was buried') - Jesus\u2019 sufferings took their historical, concrete form from the fact that he was \u201crejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes,\u201d who handed \u201chim to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified.\u201d (abbreviated) - 649 (in 'The Resurrection - A Work of the Holy Trinity') - As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his divine power. Jesus announces that the Son of man will have to suffer much, die, and then rise (abbreviated) - 459 (in 'Why did the word become flesh?') - Jesus is the model for the Beatitudes and the norm of the new law: \u201cLove one another as I have loved you.\u201d This love implies an effective offering of oneself, after his example (abbreviated) - 1615 (in 'Marriage in the Lord') - By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to \u201creceive\u201d the original meaning of marriage and live it with the help of Christ (abbreviated) - 2544 (in 'Poverty of Heart') - Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them \u201crenounce all that [they have]\u201d for his sake and that of the Gospel (abbreviated)  Got a Bible question?
