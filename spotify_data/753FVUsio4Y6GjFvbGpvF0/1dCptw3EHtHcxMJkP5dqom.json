Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1851 (in 'The Definition of Sin') - It is precisely in the Passion, when the mercy of Christ is about to vanquish it, that sin most clearly manifests its violence and its many forms: unbelief, murderous hatred, shunning and mockery by the leaders and the people, Pilate's cowardice and the cruelty of the soldiers, Judas' betrayal - so bitter to Jesus, Peter's denial and the disciples' flight. However, at the very hour of darkness, the hour of the prince of this world, the sacrifice of Christ secretly becomes the source from which the forgiveness of our sins will pour forth inexhaustibly. - 2853 (in 'But Deliver us from Evil') - Victory over the \"prince of this world\" was won once for all at the Hour when Jesus freely gave himself up to death to give us his life. This is the judgment of this world, and the prince of this world is \"cast out\" (abbreviated). - 606 (in 'Christ's whole life is an offering to the Father') - The Son of God, who came down \"from heaven, not to do (his) own will, but the will of him who sent (him)\", said on coming into the world, \"Lo, I have come to do your will, O God.\" \"and by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.\" From the first moment of his Incarnation the Son embraces the Father's plan of divine salvation in his redemptive mission: \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.\" The sacrifice of Jesus \"for the sins of the whole world\" expresses his loving communion with the Father. \"The Father loves me, because I lay down my life\", said the Lord, \"(for) I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.\"  Got a Bible question?
