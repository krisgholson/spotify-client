Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 470 (in 'How is the Son of God Man?') - The Son of God therefore communicates to his humanity his own personal mode of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body, Christ thus expresses humanly the divine ways of the Trinity (abbreviated). - 516 (in 'Characteristics common to Jesus' ministry') - Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of the Father. Jesus can say: \"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father\", and the Father can say: \"This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!\" Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father's will, even the least characteristics of his mysteries manifest \"God's love. . . among us\". - 2614 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be, once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is new is to \"ask in his name.\" Faith in the Son introduces the disciples into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is \"the way, and the truth, and the life\" (abbreviated). - 2633 (in 'Prayer of Petition') - When we share in God's saving love, we understand that every need can become the object of petition. Christ, who assumed all things in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name (abbreviated). - 2815 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - Prayer to our Father is our prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus (abbreviated).
