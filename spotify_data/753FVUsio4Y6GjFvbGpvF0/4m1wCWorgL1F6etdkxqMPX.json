Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2466 (in 'Living in the Truth') - In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made manifest. \"Full of grace and truth,\" he came as the \"light of the world,\" he is the Truth. \"Whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.\" The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know \"the truth [that] will make you free\" and that sanctifies. To follow Jesus is to live in \"the Spirit of truth,\" whom the Father sends in his name and who leads \"into all the truth.\" To his disciples Jesus teaches the unconditional love of truth: \"Let what you say be simply 'Yes or No.'\" - 679 (in 'To Judge the Living and the Dead') - Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive judgement on the works and hearts of men belongs to him as redeemer of the world. He \"acquired\" this right by his cross. the Father has given \"all judgement to the Son\". Yet the Son did not come to judge, but to save and to give the life he has in himself. By rejecting grace in this life, one already judges oneself, receives according to one's works, and can even condemn oneself for all eternity by rejecting the Spirit of love. - 1039 (in 'The Last Judgement') - In the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of each man's relationship with God will be laid bare (abbreviated).
