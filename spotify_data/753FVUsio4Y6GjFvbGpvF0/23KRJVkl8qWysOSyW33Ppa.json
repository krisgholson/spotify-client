Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1858 (in 'The Gravity of Sin: Mortal and Venial Sin') - Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments, corresponding to the answer of Jesus to the rich young man: \"Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.\" The gravity of sins is more or less great: murder is graver than theft. One must also take into account who is wronged: violence against parents is in itself graver than violence against a stranger. - 2728 (in 'Objections to Prayer') - Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as failure in prayer: discouragement during periods of dryness; sadness that, because we have \"great possessions,\" we have not given all to the Lord; disappointment over not being heard according to our own will; wounded pride, stiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and unmerited gift; and so forth. the conclusion is always the same: what good does it do to pray? To overcome these obstacles, we must battle to gain humility, trust, and perseverance.  Got a Bible question?
