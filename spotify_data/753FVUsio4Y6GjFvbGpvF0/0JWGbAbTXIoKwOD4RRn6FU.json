Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 535-536 (in 'The Baptism of Jesus') - Jesus\u2019 public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches \u201ca baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.\u201d A crowd of sinners\u2014tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes\u2014come to be baptized by him. \u201cThen Jesus appears.\u201d The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, \u201cThis is my beloved Son.\u201d This is the manifestation (\u201cEpiphany\u201d) of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God\u2019s suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\u201d Already he is anticipating the \u201cbaptism\u201d of his bloody death. Already he is coming to \u201cfulfill all righteousness,\u201d that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father\u2019s will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father\u2019s voice responds to the Son\u2019s acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to \u201crest on him.\u201d Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism \u201cthe heavens were opened\u201d\u2014the heavens that Adam\u2019s sin had closed\u2014and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. - 1286 (in 'Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation') - In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving mission. The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism by John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the Son of God. - 1223-1224 (in 'Christ's Baptism') - All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus. He begins his public life after having himself baptized by St. John the Baptist in the Jordan...Our Lord voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of St. John, intended for sinners, in order to \u201cfulfill all righteousness.\u201d Jesus\u2019 gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying. The Spirit who had hovered over the waters of the first creation descended then on the Christ as a prelude of the new creation, and the Father revealed Jesus as his \u201cbeloved Son.\u201d - 701 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - When Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him (abbreviated) - 444 (in 'The Only Son of God') - The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father designates Jesus his \u201cbeloved Son.\u201d  Got a Bible question?
