Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1618 (in 'Virginity for the Sake of the Kingdom') - Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social. From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming (abbreviated). - 2544 (in 'Poverty of Heart') - Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them \u201crenounce all that [they have]\u201d for his sake and that of the Gospel. Shortly before his passion he gave them the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on. The precept of detachment from riches is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven.  Got a Bible question?
