    "description": "To support the\u00a0ministry and get access to exclusive content, go to: http://patreon.com/logicalbiblestudy  Luke 3: 15-16, 21-22 - 'Someone is coming who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.'  Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 696 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - John the Baptist, who goes \"before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah,\" proclaims Christ as the one who \"will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire\" (abbreviated). - 2600 (in 'Jesus Prays') - The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of the Holy Spirit and the meaning of prayer in Christ's ministry. Jesus prays before the decisive moments of his mission: before his Father's witness to him during his baptism and Transfiguration, and before his own fulfillment of the Father's plan of love by his Passion. He also prays before the decisive moments involving the mission of his apostles: at his election and call of the Twelve, before Peter's confession of him as \"the Christ of God,\" and again that the faith of the chief of the Apostles may not fail when tempted. Jesus' prayer before the events of salvation that the Father has asked him to fulfill is a humble and trusting commitment of his human will to the loving will of the Father. - 536 (in 'The Baptism of Jesus') - The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already \"the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world\". Already he is anticipating the \"baptism\" of his bloody death. Already he is coming to \"fulfil all righteousness\", that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father's voice responds to the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to \"rest on him\". Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism \"the heavens were opened\"- the heavens that Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation.
