Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 530 (in 'The Mysteries of Jesus' Infancy') - The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents make manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: \u201cHe came to his own home, and his own people received him not.\u201d Christ\u2019s whole life was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him. Jesus\u2019 departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the definitive liberator of God\u2019s people. - 333 (in 'Christ with all his angels') - From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels. When God \u201cbrings the firstborn into the world, he says: \u2018Let all God\u2019s angels worship him.\u2019\u201d Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church\u2019s praise: \u201cGlory to God in the highest!\u201d They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been (abbreviated).
