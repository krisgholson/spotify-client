Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2613 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - Three principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St. Luke: the importunate friend,\" invites us to urgent prayer: \"Knock, and it will be opened to you.\" To the one who prays like this, the heavenly Father will \"give whatever he needs,\" and above all the Holy Spirit who contains all gifts (abbreviated). - 2761 (in 'The Lord's Prayer') - The Lord's Prayer \"is truly the summary of the whole gospel.\" \"Since the Lord . . . after handing over the practice of prayer, said elsewhere, 'Ask and you will receive,' and since everyone has petitions which are peculiar to his circumstances, the regular and appropriate prayer [the Lord's Prayer] is said first, as the foundation of further desires.\" - 443 (in 'The Only Son of God') - He distinguished his sonship from that of his disciples by never saying \"our Father\", except to command them: \"You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father'\", and he emphasized this distinction, saying \"my Father and your Father\" (abbreviated). - 728 (in 'Christ Jesus') - Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself has been glorified through his Death and Resurrection. Nevertheless, little by little he alludes to him even in his teaching of the multitudes, as when he reveals that his own flesh will be food for the life of the world. He also alludes to the Spirit in speaking to Nicodemus, to the Samaritan woman, and to those who take part in the feast of Tabernacles. To his disciples he speaks openly of the Spirit in connection with prayer and with the witness they will have to bear.  Got a Bible question?
