Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 982 (in 'The Power of the Keys') - There is no offense, however serious, that the Church cannot forgive. \"There is no one, however wicked and guilty, who may not confidently hope for forgiveness, provided his repentance is honest. Christ who died for all men desires that in his Church the gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from sin. - 2227 (in 'The Duties of Parents') - Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect. Mutual affection suggests this. The charity of Christ demands it. - 2843 (in 'as we forgive those who trespass against us') - Thus the Lord's words on forgiveness, the love that loves to the end, become a living reality. the parable of the merciless servant, which crowns the Lord's teaching on ecclesial communion, ends with these words: \"So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\" It is there, in fact, \"in the depths of the heart,\" that everything is bound and loosed. It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession.
