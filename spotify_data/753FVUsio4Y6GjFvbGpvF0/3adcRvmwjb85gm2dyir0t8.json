Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 581-582 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi. He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the Law. Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people \u201cas one who had authority, and not as their scribes\"...In presenting with divine authority the definitive interpretation of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by certain teachers of the Law who did not accept his interpretation of the Law, guaranteed though it was by the divine signs that accompanied it. This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, for he recalls often with rabbinical arguments, that the sabbath rest is not violated by serving God and neighbor, which his own healings did.\" (abbreviated) - 2173 (in 'The Sabbath Day') - The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the sabbath law. But Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day. He gives this law its authentic and authoritative interpretation: \u201cThe sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.\u201d With compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing. The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God. \u201cThe Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.\u201d - 586 (in 'Jesus and the Temple') - Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the essential part of his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the Temple-tax, associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the foundation of his future Church. He even identified himself with the Temple by presenting himself as God's definitive dwelling-place among men (abbreviated). - 590 (in 'Jesus and Israel's faith in the One God and Saviour') - Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a claim as \"He who is not with me is against me\"; and his saying that there was in him \"something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than Solomon\", something \"greater than the Temple\"; his reminder that David had called the Messiah his Lord, and his affirmations, \"Before Abraham was, I AM\", and even \"I and the Father are one.\" - 2100 (in 'Sacrifice') - Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of spiritual sacrifice: \"The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit....\" The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of neighbor. Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: \"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice\" (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
