Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 244 (in 'The Father and the Son revealed by the Spirit') - The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in time. the Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had returned to the Father. The sending of the person of the Spirit after Jesus' glorification reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy Trinity. - 248 (in 'The Father and the Son revealed by the Spirit') - At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he \"who proceeds from the Father\", \u00a0it affirms that he comes from the Father through the Son. The Western \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(filioque). It says this, \"legitimately and with good reason\", for the eternal order of the divine persons in their consubstantial communion implies that the Father, as \"the principle without principle\", is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds. This legitimate complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed. - 263 (in 'The Holy Spirit') - The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son (Jn 14:26) and by the Son \"from the Father\" (Jn 15:26), reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. \"With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified\" (Nicene Creed). - 692 (in 'Titles of the Holy Spirit') - When he proclaims and promises the coming of the Holy Spirit, Jesus calls him the \"Paraclete,\" literally, \"he who is called to one's side,\" advocatus. \"Paraclete\" is commonly translated by \"consoler,\" and Jesus is the first consoler (abbreviated). - 719 (in 'John, precursor, prophet and baptist') - As the Spirit of truth will also do, John \"came to bear witness to the light\" (abbreviated). - 729 (in 'Christ Jesus') - Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does Jesus promise the coming of the Holy Spirit, since his Death and Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers. The Spirit of truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in answer to Jesus' prayer; he will be sent by the Father in Jesus' name; and Jesus will send him from the Father's side, since he comes from the Father. the Holy Spirit will come and we shall know him; he will be with us for ever; he will remain with us. the Spirit will teach us everything, remind us of all that Christ said to us and bear witness to him. the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth and will glorify Christ. He will prove the world wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment. - 1433 (in 'Interior Penance') -Since Easter, the Holy Spirit has proved \"the world wrong about sin,\" i.e., proved that the world has not believed in him whom the Father has sent. But this same Spirit who brings sin to light is also the Consoler who gives the human heart grace for repentance and conversion.  Got a Bible question?
