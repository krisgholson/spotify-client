Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 765 (in 'The Church - instituted by Christ Jesus') - Representing the twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new Jerusalem. The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ's mission and his power, but also in his lot (abbreviated). - 530 (in 'The Mysteries of Jesus' Infancy') - The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents make manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: \"He came to his own home, and his own people received him not.\" Christ's whole life was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him (abbreviated). - 675 (in 'The Church's ultimate trial') - Before Christ's second coming the Church must pass through a final trial that will shake the faith of many believers. The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth will unveil the \"mystery of iniquity\" (abbreviated).  Got a Bible question?
