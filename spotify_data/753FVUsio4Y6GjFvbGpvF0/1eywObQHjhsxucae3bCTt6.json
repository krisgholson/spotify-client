Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 332 (in 'Christ with all his angels') - Angels have been present since creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from afar or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the earthly paradise; protected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed Abraham\u2019s hand; communicated the law by their ministry; led the People of God; announced births and callings; and assisted the prophets, just to cite a few examples. Finally, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of the Precursor and that of Jesus himself. - 717-718 (in 'John, precursor, prophet and baptist') - \u201cThere was a man sent from God, whose name was John.\u201d John was \u201cfilled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother\u2019s womb\u201d by Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just conceived by the Holy Spirit (abbreviated). John is \u201cElijah [who] must come.\u201d The fire of the Spirit dwells in him and makes him the forerunner of the coming Lord. In John, the precursor, the Holy Spirit completes the work of \u201c[making] ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d - 523 (in 'Preparations') - Going before Jesus \u201cin the spirit and power of Elijah,\u201d John bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of conversion, and through his martyrdom (abbreviated) - 696 (in 'Symbols of the Holy Spirit') - This event was a \u201cfigure\u201d of the fire of the Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches. John the Baptist, who goes \u201cbefore [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah,\u201d proclaims Christ as the one who \u201cwill baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire\" (abbreviated) - 716 (in 'Expectation of the Messiah & his Spirit') - It is this quality of heart, purified and enlightened by the Spirit, which is expressed in the Psalms. In these poor, the Spirit is making ready \u201ca people prepared for the Lord\" (abbreviated) - 2684 (in 'the Cloud of Witnesses') - In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities have been developed throughout the history of the churches. The personal charism of some witnesses to God\u2019s love for men has been handed on, like \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Elijah to Elisha and John the Baptist, so that their followers may have a share in this spirit (abbreviated). - 1070 (in 'What does the word liturgy mean?') - In the New Testament the word \u201cliturgy\u201d refers not only to the celebration of divine worship but also to the proclamation of the Gospel and to active charity (abbreviated).
