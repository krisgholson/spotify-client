Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1936 (In' Equality & Differences among Men') - \"On coming into the world, man is not equipped with everything he needs for developing his bodily and spiritual life. He needs others. Differences appear tied to age, physical abilities, intellectual or moral aptitudes, the benefits derived from social commerce, and the distribution of wealth. The \u201ctalents\u201d are not distributed equally.\" - 1880 (In 'The Communal Character of the Human Vocation') - A society is a group of persons bound together organically by a principle of unity that goes beyond each one of them. As an assembly that is at once visible and spiritual, a society endures through time: it gathers up the past and prepares for the future. By means of society, each man is established as an \u201cheir\u201d and receives certain \u201ctalents\u201d that enrich his identity and whose fruits he must develop. He rightly owes loyalty to the communities of which he is part and respect to those in authority who have charge of the common good.  Got a Bible question?
