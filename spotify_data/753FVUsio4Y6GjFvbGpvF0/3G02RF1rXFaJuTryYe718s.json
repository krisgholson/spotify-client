Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: -641 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish anointing the body of Jesus, which had been buried in haste because the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the first to encounter the Risen One. Thus the women were the first messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves (abbreviated). - 2174 (in 'The Day of the Resurrection: the new creation') - Jesus rose from the dead \"on the first day of the week.\" Because it is the \"first day,\" the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the first creation. Because it is the \"eighth day\" following the sabbath, it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera,dies dominica) Sunday: We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead.\" - 333 (in 'Christ with all his angels') - Again, it is the angels who \"evangelize\" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection (abbreviated). - 652 (in 'The Meaning and Saving Significance of the Resurrection') - Christ's Resurrection is the fulfilment of the promises both of the Old Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly life. The phrase \"in accordance with the Scriptures\" indicates that Christ's Resurrection fulfilled these predictions.  Got a Bible question?
