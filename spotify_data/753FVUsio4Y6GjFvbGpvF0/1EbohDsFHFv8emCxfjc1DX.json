Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 849 (in 'Mission - a requirement of the Church's catholicity') - The missionary mandate. \"Having been divinely sent to the nations that she might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,' the Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and because it is demanded by her own essential universality, strives to preach the Gospel to all men\": \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and Lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age.\" - 1257 (in 'The Necessity of Baptism') - The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation. He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to baptize them. Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament (abbreviated). - 232 (in 'in the Name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit') - Christians are baptized \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\" Before receiving the sacrament, they respond to a three-part question when asked to confess the Father, the Son and the Spirit: \"I do.\" \"The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity.\" - 831 (in 'What does Catholic Mean?') - Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent out by Christ on a mission to the whole of the human race: All men are called to belong to the new People of God. This People, therefore, while remaining one and only one, is to be spread throughout the whole world and to all ages in order that the design of God's will may be fulfilled: he made human nature one in the beginning and has decreed that all his children who were scattered should be finally gathered together as one.... the character of universality which adorns the People of God is a gift from the Lord himself whereby the Catholic Church ceaselessly and efficaciously seeks for the return of all humanity and all its goods, under Christ the Head in the unity of his Spirit. - 2743 (in 'Persevering in Love') - It is always possible to pray: the time of the Christian is that of the risen Christ who is with us always, no matter what tempests may arise. Our time is in the hands of God (abbreviated). - 1120 (in 'The Sacraments of the Church') - The ordained priesthood guarantees that it really is Christ who acts in the sacraments through the Holy Spirit for the Church. the saving mission entrusted by the Father to his incarnate Son was committed to the apostles and through them to their successors: they receive the Spirit of Jesus to act in his name and in his person (abbreviated). - 644 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - 2 (in 'Prologue') - 767 (in 'The Church - revealed by the Holy Spirit') - 189 (in 'The Creeds') - 543 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - 691 (in 'The Proper name of the Holy Spirit') - 2156 (in 'The Christian Name') - 80 (in 'One Common Source') - 788 (in 'The Church is communion with Jesus') - 860 (in 'The Apostles Mission')  Got a Bible question?
