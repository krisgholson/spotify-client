Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1094 (in 'The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ') - It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal catechesis of the Lord is built, and then, that of the Apostles and the Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called \"typological\" because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of the \"figures\" (types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth, starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled (abbreviated). - 1347 (in 'The Mass of All ages') - Is this not the same movement as the Paschal meal of the risen Jesus with his disciples? Walking with them he explained the Scriptures to them; sitting with them at table \"he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.\" - 643 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - Given all these testimonies, Christ's Resurrection cannot be interpreted as something outside the physical order, and it is impossible not to acknowledge it as an historical fact. It is clear from the facts that the disciples' faith was drastically put to the test by their master's Passion and death on the cross, which he had foretold. The shock provoked by the Passion was so great that at least some of the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the Resurrection. Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation, the Gospels present us with disciples demoralized (\"looking sad\") and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning from the tomb and had regarded their words as an \"idle tale\". When Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter evening, \"he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.\" - 601 (in 'He Died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures') - Citing a confession of faith that he himself had \"received\", St. Paul professes that \"Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures.\" In particular Jesus' redemptive death fulfils Isaiah's prophecy of the suffering Servant. Indeed Jesus himself explained the meaning of his life and death in the light of God's suffering Servant. After his Resurrection he gave this interpretation of the Scriptures to the disciples at Emmaus, and then to the apostles (abbreviated). - 572 (in 'Jesus Christ Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried') - The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of \"all the Scriptures\" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: \"Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" (abbreviated). - 641 (in 'The Appearances of the Risen One') - Thus the women were the first messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves. They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter, then the Twelve. Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his brothers, and so sees the Risen One before them; it is on the basis of his testimony that the community exclaims: \"The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\" (abbreviated). - 1329 (in 'What is this sacrament called?') - 659 (in 'He Ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father') - 439 (in 'Christ')  Got a Bible question?
