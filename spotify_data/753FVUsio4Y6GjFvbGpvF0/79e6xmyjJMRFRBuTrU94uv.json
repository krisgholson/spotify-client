Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 330 (In 'Who are Angels'?) - As purely spiritual creatures angels have intelligence and will: they are personal and immortal creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible creatures, as the splendor of their glory bears witness. - 575 (In 'Jesus and Israel') - Many of Jesus\u2019 deeds and words constituted a \u201csign of contradiction,\u201d but more so for the religious authorities in Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply \u201cthe Jews,\u201d than for the ordinary People of God. To be sure, Christ\u2019s relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical. Some Pharisees warned him of the danger he was courting; Jesus praises some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at their homes. Jesus endorses some of the teachings imparted by this religious elite of God\u2019s people: the resurrection of the dead, certain forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting, and prayer), the custom of addressing God as Father.
