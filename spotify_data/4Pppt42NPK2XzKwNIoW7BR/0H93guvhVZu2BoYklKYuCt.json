    "description": "Fr. Mike expands on the passage we read in Proverbs, and emphasizes how important it is to surround ourselves with people who are striving towards holiness. He also reflects on the book of Isaiah, and how these last couple of stories show that God's justice is always aligned with his infinite mercy. Today's readings are Isaiah 63-64, Ezekiel 21-22, and Proverbs 13:17-20. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
