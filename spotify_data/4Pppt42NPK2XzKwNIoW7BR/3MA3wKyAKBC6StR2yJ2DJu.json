    "description": "Fr. Mike encourages us not to be discouraged about the small things happening in our lives, because just as we see through Zechariah's visions, God takes small things and turns them into great triumphs. He also touches on the dedication of Israel to rebuild the temple, and the connection between the crowing of Joshua and the crowning of Christ the King. Today's readings are Ezra 5-6, Zechariah 4-6, and Proverbs 20:8-11. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
