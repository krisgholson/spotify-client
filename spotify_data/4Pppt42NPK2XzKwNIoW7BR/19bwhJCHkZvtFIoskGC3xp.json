    "description": "Fr. Mike points out how violence begets violence in the reading from 2 Samuel, and shows us how the sins we commit extend much further than ourselves. We also read about the Temple musicians in 1 Chronicles, we hear Psalm 39, written by one of those musicians, Jeduthun. Today's reading are 2 Samuel 20, 1 Chronicles 25, and Psalm 39.
