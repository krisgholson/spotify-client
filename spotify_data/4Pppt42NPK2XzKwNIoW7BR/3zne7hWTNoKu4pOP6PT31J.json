    "description": "Fr. Mike reinforces Jesus' divinity as we read about how Jesus heals people physically, mentally, and spiritually and frees them from the enemy's kingdom of darkness. Fr. Mike also encourages us to not be afraid when we experience persecution and division for the sake of Christ, but to rather courageously carry the Cross.
