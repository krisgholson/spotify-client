    "description": "Fr. Mike walks us through the current battles of Judas Maccabeus and the Israelite people, emphasizing that while war is violent, freedom to belong to God and worship him is worth fighting for. He also discusses the importance of spending time with virtuous people to acquire their positive qualities and the need to seek good rather than evil to attain the riches of heaven. Today\u2019s readings are from 1 Maccabees 5, Sirach 13-15, and Proverbs 22:13-16. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
