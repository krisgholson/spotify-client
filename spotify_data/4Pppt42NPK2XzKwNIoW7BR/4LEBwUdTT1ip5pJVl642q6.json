    "description": "In light of a series of miracles in our readings for today, Fr. Mike focuses on our Lord\u2019s compassion and our call to be merciful, as he is. He emphasizes the beauty of God\u2019s mercy and his offering of it despite our unworthiness. He also strikes a balance between the goodness of humanity as God\u2019s creation and our brokenness due to original sin. Today\u2019s readings are Luke 6-8 and Proverbs 26:1-3.
