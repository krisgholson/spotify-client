    "description": "In today's readings, Fr. Mike highlights David's humility in two instances: when David asked the Gibeonites how he could repair their relationship after they had been mistreated by Saul, and when David takes a step back from battle. He also explains the role of the gatekeepers as people who would be responsible for guarding the doors to the Temple. The readings are 2 Samuel 21, 1 Chronicles 26, and Psalm 40.
