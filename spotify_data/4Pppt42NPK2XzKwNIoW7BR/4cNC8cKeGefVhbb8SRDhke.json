    "description": "Fr. Mike recalls Hezekiah's prayer for more time and reveals how Hezekiah did not use that time wisely. We all are only given a specific amount of time on this earth, and it's up to us to use that time to become more like Christ, so we can spend eternity with him in heaven. Today's readings are 2 Kings 21, 2 Chronicles 32, and Psalm 145. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
