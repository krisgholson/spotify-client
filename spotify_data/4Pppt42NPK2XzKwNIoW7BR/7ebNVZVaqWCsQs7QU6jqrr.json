    "description": "As we continue to read about Saul's vanity and disobedience, Fr. Mike emphasizes the importance of the virtue of obedience in our relationship with God. He also points out how God chose David to be anointed as king because David was a man after God's own heart. Today's readings are 1 Samuel 15-16 and Psalm 61.
