    "description": "Fr. Mike touches upon the prophecy of judgment against Babylon and Israel, and how God still promises to be Israel's redeemer despite their disobedience.  We also read about Ezekiel's vision of the temple and how the markings on the foreheads of the Israelites symbolizes the mourning of true worship, and also foreshadows Jesus' death on the Cross. Today we read Isaiah 47-48, Ezekiel 8-9, and Proverbs 12:13-16. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
