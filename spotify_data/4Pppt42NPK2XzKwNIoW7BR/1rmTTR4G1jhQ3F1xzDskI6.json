    "description": "Fr. Mike focuses on Isaiah 22 today and explains how the role of the pope in the Catholic Church goes all the way back to this important chapter in Isaiah. We learn that Jesus himself instituted the papacy by making Peter his 'al-habbayit, the one over the household who holds the keys to the kingdom when the king is away. Today's readings are Isaiah 21-22, Nahum 3, and Proverbs 10:29-32. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
