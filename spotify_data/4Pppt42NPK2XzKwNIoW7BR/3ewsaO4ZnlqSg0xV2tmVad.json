    "description": "As we continue our journey in 1 Maccabees, Fr. Mike explains that this book of the Bible is unlike others because it narrates stories and events without providing any interpretation.  In Sirach, Fr. Mike stresses the teaching on the power of our words and the gravity of gossip and slander. Today's readings are 1 Maccabees 11, Sirach 28-29, and Proverbs 23:9-12.
