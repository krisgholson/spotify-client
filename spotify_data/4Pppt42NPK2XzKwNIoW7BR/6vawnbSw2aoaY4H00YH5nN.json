    "description": "Fr. Mike takes us through the last chapter of Isaiah by explaining how our emotions can sometimes get in the way of us responding well to those around us. This means mourning with those who mourn, and rejoicing with those who rejoice, as Isaiah teaches us in preparation for the coming of Christ. Today's readings are Isaiah 66, Ezekiel 25-26, and Proverbs 14:1-4. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
