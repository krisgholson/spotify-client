    "description": "Fr. Mike explains why Joel would say that there are certain times for war, even within God's plan. In a broken world, we are sometimes going to be called to fight the brokenness around us, but we must believe that God is allowing this not because he likes war, but because something better will come in its place. Today's readings are Isaiah 16-17, Joel 3, and Proverbs 10:21-24. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
