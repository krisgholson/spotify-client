    "description": "As we continue reading from 1 Samuel, Fr. Mike points out how God gave the people a king like they wanted, even though it was not part of his plan. This reveals to us that even when we choose things that God does not want for us, he is still with us. The readings are 1 Samuel 11-12 and Psalm 55.
