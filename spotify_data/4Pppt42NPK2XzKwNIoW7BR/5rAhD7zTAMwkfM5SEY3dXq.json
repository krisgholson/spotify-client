    "description": "Fr. Mike comments on the growing divide between Judaism and Christianity that Paul experiences on mission in Acts 21. In 2 Corinthians, Fr.

We also learn about the importance of imitating the generosity of Christ. Today's readings are Acts 21, 2 Corinthians 6-8, and Proverbs 29:1-4.
