Mike draws our attention to the first five accusations Zephaniah declares against the people of Judah; idolatry, lack of prayer, poor leadership, superstitions, and lack of belief in God's judgment. Today we read Isaiah 28-29, Zephaniah 1-2, and Proverbs 11:9-12. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
