    "description": "Fr. Mike emphasizes how King David's victories in battle are part of his calling to establish Israel as a kingdom. He also reminds us that the recapitulation of the events we read about 1 Chronicles 10-11, is not repetitive, it served a specific purpose for the people of Israel. Today we read 2 Samuel 8, 1 Chronicles 10-11 and Psalm 60. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
