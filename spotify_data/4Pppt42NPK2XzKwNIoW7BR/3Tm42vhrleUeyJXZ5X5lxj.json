    "description": "Fr. Mike summarizes the final moments of the book of Nehemiah, when Nehemiah returns to find the people of Israel being unfaithful to God\u2019s commandments and marrying foreign wives. Fr. Mike connects this to our lives, as we too often confuse God\u2019s unending love for us to mean that he always wants what we want.Today\u2019s readings are Nehemiah 13, Malachi 1-4, and Proverbs 21: 25-28.
