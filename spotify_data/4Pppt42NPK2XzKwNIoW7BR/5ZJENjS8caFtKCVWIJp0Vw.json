    "description": "Fr. Mike offers a brief recap of today\u2019s chapter from Nehemiah, identifying the difference between those who were able to live in Jerusalem and those who were not. He explains the ancestral gifts that each tribe of Israel received and applies this concept to the vices and virtues of our families, as well as our freedom to adopt or reject them. Today we read from Nehemiah 11, Esther 8, 16, and Proverbs 21:17-20. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
