    "description": "In our reading of Proverbs 14, Fr. Mike reinforces that freedom is not the same thing as license, true freedom is the power to do what we ought. Fr. Mike also reflects on Jeremiah's repudiation of Israel's cult worship and how its distorted sexuality had serious consequences. Today's readings are Jeremiah 3,  Ezekiel 29-30, and  Proverbs 14:13-16. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
