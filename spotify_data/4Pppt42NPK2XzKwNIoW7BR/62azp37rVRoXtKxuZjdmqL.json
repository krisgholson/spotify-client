    "description": "Today's readings remind us that all good things come from God, and he calls us to specific places and times for a reason. In the book of Esther, Fr. Mike points out that Esther was perfectly positioned to fulfill God's will. We too, can examine our lives and realize that there are places God has brought us, \"for such a time as this\". The readings are Nehemiah 9, Esther 4 and 14, and Proverbs 21:9-12. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
