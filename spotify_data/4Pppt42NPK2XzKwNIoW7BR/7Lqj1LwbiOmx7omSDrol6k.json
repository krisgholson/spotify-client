    "description": "Fr. Mike compares the messages of Isaiah and Ezekiel, one coming from a pre-exile time and the other from a post-exile time. Even though they are coming from two very different points in salvation history, they both are persistent in speaking the Word of God, and sharing his consolation with the people of Israel. Today's readings are Isaiah 41-42, Ezekiel 2-3, and Proverbs 12:1-4. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
