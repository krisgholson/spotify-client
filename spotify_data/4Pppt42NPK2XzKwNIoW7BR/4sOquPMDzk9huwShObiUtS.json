    "description": "Fr. Mike highlights the works of King Cyrus, who we met yesterday, and how he is able to contribute to the will of God without actually knowing him. Cyrus not only shows us that no soul is ever too far for God's grace, but that God makes all things new, and is able to bring beautiful blessings from the most desperate situations. Today's readings are Isaiah 45-46, Ezekiel 6-7, and Proverbs 12:9-12. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
