    "description": "Fr. Mike continues to describe Nehemiah\u2019s process of rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem and encountering a variety of challenges in his calling. He explains that in doing God's work,  we will often face internal or external opposition which we must meet with prayer and perseverance, trusting God entirely. Today\u2019s readings are Nehemiah 4-5, Esther 11-12, and Proverbs 20:27-30. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
