    "description": "Fr. Mike brings us into the book of Consolation as we continue through Isaiah, and learn about how God never fails to comfort his people, even in the worst of times. He also introduces us to the Prophet Ezekiel, as we read about God accompanying his people into exile, even after their unfaithfulness. Today's readings are Isaiah 39-40, Ezekiel 1, and Proverbs 11:29-31. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
