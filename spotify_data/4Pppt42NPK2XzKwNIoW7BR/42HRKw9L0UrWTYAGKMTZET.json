    "description": "Fr. Mike draws our attention to the cultural division present in the early Church and the origin of the ordination to the diaconate. He also discusses Paul\u2019s frustration with those who didn\u2019t recognize Jesus as the Christ and offers consolation to those who experience this in the hearts and minds of those close to them, as Paul did. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 6, Romans 9-10, and Proverbs 27:10-12.
