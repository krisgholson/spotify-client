    "description": "Fr. Mike explains the significance behind the mention of bones in Jeremiah and Ezekiel.  In Jeremiah, we learn that the bones of God's people are scattered because of their worship of false gods. In Ezekiel, we see the prophet prophesy over the valley of dry bones and the Lord\u2019s Spirit restoring and moving within them. Today\u2019s readings are Jeremiah 8, Ezekiel 37-38, and Proverbs 14:33-35. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
