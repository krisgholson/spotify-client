    "description": "Fr. Mike explains how God\u2019s favor was with  Ezra because he set his heart to study God's laws, to obey his laws, and to teach his laws to others. We also learn about hypocritical fasting, and how our sacrifices should remind us that everything ultimately belongs to God at all times. Today's readings are Ezra 7-8, Zechariah 7-8, and Proverbs 20:12-15. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
