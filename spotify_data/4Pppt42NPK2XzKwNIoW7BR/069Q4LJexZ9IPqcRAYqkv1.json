    "description": "Fr. Mike reflects on Stephen's heroic martyrdom and points out how those around him refused to hear him and hardened their hearts, something we too can do with the Word of God. In the book of Romans, Fr. Mike also highlights the importance of offering our bodies as a living sacrifice, responding to the call to love and to not be conformed to this world, and remembering that Christians have been grafted onto the tree of Israel. Today we read Acts 7, Romans 11-12, and Proverbs 27:13-14.  For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
