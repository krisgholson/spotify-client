    "description": "Fr. Mike reminds us of the context of Galatians and reiterates Paul\u2019s admonition not to revert to our previous ways of life now that we have been freed from the yoke of slavery. He also discusses the works of the flesh which separate us from Christ and the fruits of the spirit which result from a life lived in God, reminding us that we will reap what we sow in due season. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 25, Galatians 4-6, and Proverbs 29:15-17. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
