    "description": "As we hear the re-telling of the story of Judas Maccabbeus and his brothers fighting for the honor of the Lord's Temple in 2 Maccabees, Fr. Mike points out how this version gives us an insight into their recognition of God's presence, mercy, and justice in their circumstances. We learn that no matter what we are going through, we can trust that God is our great defender who is present and active in all circumstances of our lives. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 8, Wisdom 5-6, and Proverbs 24:30-34. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
