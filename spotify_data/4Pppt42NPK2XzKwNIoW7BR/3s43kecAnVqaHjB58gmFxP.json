    "description": "Fr. Mike walks us through the Church\u2019s first council in Acts 15 and highlights the importance of the Church\u2019s authority in the question of circumcision for Gentile converts. He also draws our attention to Paul\u2019s treatment of God the Father and God the Son as equal but not the same. This sheds light on Paul\u2019s conversation about head coverings for women in our reading from 1 Corinthians and reassures female believers about their roles in marriage and the Church. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 15, 1 Corinthians 11-12, Proverbs 28:10-12. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
