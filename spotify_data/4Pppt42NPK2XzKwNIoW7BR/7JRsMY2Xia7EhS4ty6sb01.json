    "description": "In Acts 22, Paul's testimony falls on hostile Roman ears, and he narrowly escapes scourging by way of his Roman citizenship. Reflecting on this incident, Fr. Mike reminds us that God uses Paul's past to further his ministry, and that God does the same with each of us, today. Commenting on today's readings from 2 Corinthians, Fr. Mike highlights that we are called to be cheerful givers and disciplined thinkers. He also points out that, as Paul reminds us, the most important ministry credential is to be called by God and equipped by his grace. Today's readings are Acts 22, 2 Corinthians 9-11, and Proverbs 29:5-7.  For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
