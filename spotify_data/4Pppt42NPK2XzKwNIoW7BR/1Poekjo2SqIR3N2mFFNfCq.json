    "description": "Fr. Mike discusses our call to deny ourselves and take up our cross, specifically focusing on God\u2019s call to renounce all that is ours and trust in him. He also highlights the story of Mary and Martha and encourages us not to allow the cares of life to choke the life of God out of our lives as Martha allowed her troubles and anxieties to do. Today\u2019s readings are from Luke 9-10 and Proverbs 26:4-6. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
