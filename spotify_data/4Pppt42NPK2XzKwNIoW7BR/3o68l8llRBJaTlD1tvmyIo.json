    "description": "In Acts 3, Peter used God\u2019s gift of healing to allow God to restore a lame man. Fr. Mike reminds us that God gives us gifts so he can be known in the world and all great miracles are attributed to the name of Jesus. Fr. Mike also tells us why our suffering matters, and how God wastes nothing. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 3, Romans 4-5, and Proverbs 27:1-3.
