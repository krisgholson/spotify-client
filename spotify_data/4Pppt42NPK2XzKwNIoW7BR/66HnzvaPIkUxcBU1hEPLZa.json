    "description": "Fr. Mike emphasizes the importance of knowing God and knowing his love for us as we read about the devastation of war and the lack of faith displayed by Israel. Without a deeper knowledge of God, not only can we struggle for hope in God's plan, but we can also fall into the temptation of losing faith in him altogether. Today's readings are 2 Kings 6-7, Hosea 4-7, and Psalm 103. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
