    "description": "Fr. Mike guides us through the last two chapters of Ezekiel, explaining the biblical significance of the water flowing from the right side of the temple, and how it foreshadows Christ's passion. He also emphasizes the imagery of the clay and the potter in Jeremiah, signifying how our lives are meant to be open for God to mold and shape, according to his will. Today's readings are Jeremiah 18-19, Ezekiel 47-48, and Proverbs 15:21-24. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
