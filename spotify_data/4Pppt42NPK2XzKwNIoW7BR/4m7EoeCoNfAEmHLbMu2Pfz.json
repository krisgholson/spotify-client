    "description": "Fr. Mike explains the many parables we hear today in Matthew, including the return of the unclean spirit, and the danger of ornate souls. He emphasizes that when God sweeps the sin out of our souls, we must replace it with virtue, otherwise our souls remain empty without a relationship with God. Today's readings are Matthew 11-13 and Proverbs 19:5-8. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
