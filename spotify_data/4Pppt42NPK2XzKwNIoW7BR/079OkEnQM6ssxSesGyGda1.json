    "description": "Fr. Mike reminds us that God uses crooked lines to make a straight story, like Paul\u2019s witness to Priscilla and Aquila as they encounter the person of Christ and become missionaries. Just like Apollos accepted correction, Fr. Mike invites us to courageously open ourselves up to learning and growing. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 18, 1 Corinthians 16, and Proverbs 28:19-21. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear. Please note: The Bible contains adult themes that may not be suitable for children - parental discretion is advised.",
