    "description": "Fr. Mike highlights the goodness of Hezekiah as king of Judah but also points out his failure to protect the future of his people. While Hezekiah let his self-interest cloud his judgment, we are reminded to pray for those who will come after us, doing our best to preserve what will be theirs one day. Today's readings are 2 Kings 20, 2 Chronicles 31, and Psalm 144. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
