    "description": "Fr. Mike explains why it's better to seek counsel from those who don't necessarily always agree with us, using the experience of Rehobo\u2032am as an example. He also touches on the failed leadership of Jerobo\u2032am as he leads his people into false places of worship and idolatry. Today's readings are 1 Kings 12, 2 Chronicles 10-11, and Song of Solomon 1. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
