    "description": "Fr. Mike explains why God asks his people to surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar even though it seems contradicting. We learn that God can use evil circumstances to win the hearts of his people back. In Daniel, as we read about the vision of the ram and the goat, Fr. Mike reminds us that prophecy is always shrouded in mystery. Today we read Jeremiah 26-27, Daniel 8-9, and Proverbs 16:9-12. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
