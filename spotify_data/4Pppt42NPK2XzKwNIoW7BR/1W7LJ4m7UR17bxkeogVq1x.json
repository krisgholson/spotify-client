    "description": "Fr. Mike dives into the fall of Babylon described in Revelation 18, pointing out how several images and expressions of this key chapter are taken from the judgmental oracles in the old testament, particularly those from the prophet Jeremiah. Fr. Mike also emphasizes the reality of God\u2019s judgment, the resurrection of the dead, and how Christ\u2019s sacrifice is presented to God in the heavenly sanctuary once and for all. Today we read Revelation 18-20, Hebrews 9-10, and Proverbs 31:26-29. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
