    "description": "As we begin to wrap up the Old Testament, Fr. Mike reflects on our reading from Sirach and what we have already learned on this journey through the Bible. He emphasizes that Scripture encourages us to rise again from our sin and return to God, because our God always picks us up again with his mercy. Today\u2019s readings are 2 Maccabees 4, Sirach 47-49, and Proverbs 24:13-16. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
