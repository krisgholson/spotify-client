    "description": "Fr. Mike explains the beautiful connections between all of our readings today. He emphasizes how good shepherds are willing to face the truth, and also sacrifice for their sheep, like Jesus who laid down his life for us. In our reading of Jeremiah, Fr. Mike also explains that the experience of shame points to the reality that there is something good within us that ought not to be violated. Today we read Jeremiah 6, Ezekiel 34-35, and Proverbs 14:25-28. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear. Please note: The Bible contains adult themes that may not be suitable for children - parental discretion is advised.",
