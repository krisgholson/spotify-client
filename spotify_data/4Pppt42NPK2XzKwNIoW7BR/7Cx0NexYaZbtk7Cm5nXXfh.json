    "description": "Fr. Mike expands on the significance of establishing a covenant relationship, and how the trickery of the Gibeonites can represent the desire to enter into a relationship with God out of fear rather than out of love. Today's readings are Joshua 8-9, and Psalm 126. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
