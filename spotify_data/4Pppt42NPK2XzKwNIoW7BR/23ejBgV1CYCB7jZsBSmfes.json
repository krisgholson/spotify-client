    "description": "Today, Fr. Mike points out how the boundaries of the land of Canaan in Numbers remind us that the Promised Land is not a nice idea, but a real tangible place. He also reveals that Psalm 120 begins the Psalms of Ascent, or the Psalms that people would pray as they went up to the Temple to worship. The readings are Numbers 34, Deuteronomy 33, and Psalm 120.
