    "description": "In today's reading from Jeremiah, Fr. Mike points out how God rejoices in doing us good, and wants to pour out his grace and mercy upon us. As we begin reading from Judith, he explains that, while it might not be historically accurate, the story is there to convey truth. The readings are Jeremiah 32, Judith 1-2, and Proverbs 16:25-28.
