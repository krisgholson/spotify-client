    "description": "As we read about the many miracles Jesus performs in today's readings from Matthew, Fr. Mike asserts the objective reality of those miracles and reinforces that Jesus is truly the Son of God who has power over matter. We learn that in Jesus, we too can do things that we could never do on our own. Today's readings are Matthew 14-17, and Proverbs 19:9-12.
