    "description": "Fr. Mike explains why it was important to take a census at different points of the people of Israel in the Old Testament. We also learn that the Tribe of Levi is the only tribe that doesn't get an inheritance of land, because they're receiving something much greater. Today's readings are Numbers 26, Deuteronomy 27, and Psalm 111. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
