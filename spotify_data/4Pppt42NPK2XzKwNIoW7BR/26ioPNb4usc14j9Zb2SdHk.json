    "description": "Fr. Mike shares how verse 1 Peter 3:15 about being ready to give a reason for the faith that is within us has been one of the most influential Bible verses for him. As we start reading 1 Thessalonians today, Fr. Mike also highlights how Paul is encouraged by the faith of the Thessalonians and stresses the importance of not only sharing the gospel but also sharing our very selves. Today's readings are 1 Peter 3-5, 1 Thessalonians 1-3, and Proverbs 30:15-16. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
