He also engages with the riddles found in Wisdom 10 and points out that we can now not only understand the characters, stories, and allusions of Scripture, but can recognize the fingerprints of God in the world around us and better understand the main character of Scripture: God. Today\u2019s readings are 2 Maccabees 10, Wisdom 9-10, and Proverbs 25:4-7. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
