    "description": "Fr. Mike highlights the people of Israel's flaw in trusting in the strength and power of Egypt, not realizing that although Egypt is like a towering cedar tree, the nation will eventually collapse. Fr. Mike also points out Jeremiah's vehement message to Israel to brace themselves for God's judgment. Today we read Jeremiah 4, Ezekiel 31-32, and Proverbs 14:17-20.
