    "description": "Fr. Mike emphasizes our title as children of God as we read about the tragedy of the Babylonian exile. Even in our lowest moments, God wants us to know that he has called us each by name and has called us his, because a good Father does not abandon his children. Today's readings are Isaiah 43-44, Ezekiel 4-5, and Proverbs 12:5-8. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
