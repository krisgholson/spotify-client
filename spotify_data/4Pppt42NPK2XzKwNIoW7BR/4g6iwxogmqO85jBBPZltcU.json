    "description": "As we continue along the path of our forefathers in faith, Fr. Mike reminds us that we live in the same era as the Apostles and have the same Holy Spirit. Just like St. Paul stood out by imitating Jesus and sharing the Gospel, we are called to do the same. Fr. Mike also discusses our duality as both body and soul as it relates to Christ\u2019s resurrection. Today\u2019s readings are Acts 17, 1 Corinthians 15, and Proverbs 28:16-18.
