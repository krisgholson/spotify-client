    "description": "Fr. Mike focuses on the concept of being rich in love instead of rich in wealth today, as we read about the heart of a mother and father in our verse from Proverbs. He also emphasizes the presence of sacrificial love in the vocation of marriage and family through God's decision to keep Jeremiah single, saving him from more suffering. Today's readings are Jeremiah 16-17, Ezekiel 45-46, and Proverbs 15:17-20. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear. Please note: The Bible contains adult themes that may not be suitable for children - parental discretion is advised.",
