    "description": "Fr. Mike guides us through Judas Maccabeus' last battle, his death, and his succession. We learn that part of Judas and Jonathan's victory involved fighting fellow Jews living in the land who were not living according to God's laws. Fr. Mike points out that when the enemy is in the inside, it is especially heartbreaking. Today's readings are 1 Maccabees 9, Sirach 24-25, and Proverbs 23:1-4.
