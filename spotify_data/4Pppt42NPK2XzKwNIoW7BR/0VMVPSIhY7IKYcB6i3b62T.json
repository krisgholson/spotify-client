    "description": "Today we read about Elijah's discouragement after fleeing from Jezebel, and how God tells him to \"arise and eat\" to strengthen him for the journey ahead. Fr. Mike points out how God calls us to draw strength for the journey as well, even at the end of our earthly lives. The readings are 1 Kings 19-20, 2 Chronicles 20, and Song of Solomon 6.
