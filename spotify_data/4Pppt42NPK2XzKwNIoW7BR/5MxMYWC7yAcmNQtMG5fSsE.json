    "description": "Fr. Mike reflects on the story of Susanna's righteousness in the book of Daniel. While celebrating Susanna's virtue, Daniel's wisdom, and God's faithfulness, Fr. Mike also warns us that, like the corrupt elders in the story, we too can allow our hearts to become perverted by the things we fix our eyes on. The readings are Jeremiah 30, Daniel 12-13, and Proverbs 16:17-20. For the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.
