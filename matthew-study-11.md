### Questions

1. (2-6) Although Jesus' answer seems to merely reiterate what John already knows (that Jesus has been healing people and preaching the Good News), it actually says much more. How is Jesus elaborating on what John already knows? (Read [Isaiah 35:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2035%3A4-6&version=RSVCE), [61:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2061%3A1-2&version=RSVCE).)
1. (7-15) Jesus tells the crowd that John the Baptist is more than a prophet - he is the Elijah who is to come ([Mal 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MaL%203%3A1&version=RSVCE), [Sir 48:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2048%3A9-10&version=RSVCE), [Is 40:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2040%3A3&version=RSVCE), [Mal 4:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mal%204%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Luke 1:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A17&version=RSVCE)). He is the greatest of all the prophets, sent to prepare the way for Jesus and the kingdom. Yet, great as John is, Jesus says that even the least in the kingdom is greater than John. What do you think he means by this? ([Matt 13:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2013%3A17&version=RSVCE), [1 Peter 1:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201%3A10-12&version=RSVCE))
1. (12) (NOTE) Verse 12 is notoriously obscure ".. the kingdom of heaven as suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force". From the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: Some interpret the word violence as a reference to asceticism. In this case, it is those who discipline themselves by prayer and fasting who seize hold of the kingdom. From a historical viewpoint, it seems likely that Jesus is referring to the onset of the "messianic woes" This was the Jewish expectation that the kingdom of God would come during a time of intense tribulation and distress. These days would witness mass apostasy, rampant lawlessness, and a violent persecution of the saints. John the Baptist, executed for his witness to the Messiah ([14:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2014%3A10&version=RSVCE)), is the first of the faithful to perish with the arrival of these woeful days. Jesus will suffer the same violence ([20:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2020%3A18-19&version=RSVCE)), as will his disciples ([10:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2010%3A17-18&version=RSVCE), [23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2010%3A23&version=RSVCE); [24:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2024%3A9&version=RSVCE)).
1. (17) In Jesus' analogy .. piping recalls the joyousness of a wedding; wailing recalls the solemnity of a funeral. Who does the piping represent? Who does the wailing represent? Who are the children who will neither dance nor wail? What does the children's refusal to dance or sing represent?
1. (19) (NOTE) By accusing of Jesus of dangerous and irreligious behavior  (glutton and drunkard), the religious leaders who refuse to follow him are justifying the need to kill Jesus. (Read [Deut 21:18-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2021%3A18-21&version=RSVCE))
1. (19) (NOTE) Jesus recalls the OT tradition of personifying wisdom, and he applies these to himself based on his signs (deeds). (Read [Prov 8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov%208-9&version=RSVCE), [Wis 7:22-8:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wis%207%3A22-8%3A21&version=RSVCE), [Sir 51:13-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2051%3A13-30&version=RSVCE) - especially verse 26 in Sirach for the yoke reference)
1. (20-23) Look at the cities the Jesus references on a map in your Bible. Why the "woes" (righteous judgement) on Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum ([Matt 13:53-58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2013%3A53-58&version=RSVCE))? 
1. (23) Read [Is 14:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2014%3A13-15&version=RSVCE) (God's judgement on the king of Babylon) and compare it to Jesus' judgement on Capernaum.
1. (23-24) Sodom was wicked (sexual sin and inhospitality), yet will be judged less harsh than the unrepentant cities that Jesus mentions - why?
1. (25-30) In contrast to the unrepentant cities that reject Jesus' teaching and miracles, who are those that know the Father and "come" to Jesus?
1. (25-27) (NOTE) This thanksgiving prayer, like similar statements in John ([John 3:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A35&version=RSVCE), [John 10:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A14-15&version=RSVCE), [John 17:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A25&version=RSVCE)), point to the unique relationship and intimacy between Father and Son and the divine nature of the Blessed Trinity.
1. (29-30) Read [Sir 51:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2051%3A26-27&version=RSVCE). Jesus doesn't say there will be NO burden, but that it will be light. Compare Jesus' burden with the OT burdens as interpreted by the Pharisees .. why is Jesus' burden lighter? What makes his yoke easy?
