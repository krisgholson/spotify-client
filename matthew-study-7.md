### Questions

1. (1-2) Compare Jesus' words on judgement to his words on forgiveness (6:14). Why would we NOT want to be judged?
1. (3-4) Who is our "brother"?
1. (4-5) While called not to judge, we ARE called to help our brother avoid sin (remove the speck). What are we called to do BEFORE helping our brother? How do we remove the log from our own eye?
1. (6) My Bible's interpretation of verse 6 say that Jesus is redirecting the insulting labels of *dogs* and *swine* toward anyone who is inhospitable to the Gospel, whether Jew or Gentile ([Phil 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%203%3A2&version=RSVCE), [2 Pet 2:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet%202%3A22&version=RSVCE), [Rev 22:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2022%3A15&version=RSVCE)). What other interpretations do you have of Jesus' commands in verse 6? In Judaism, holiness characterized anything consecrated for covenant worship. To treat holy articles in a common manner would profane them. [Ex 29:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2029%3A37&version=RSVCE), [Lev 22:10-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2022%3A10-16&version=RSVCE) What is Jesus saying is holy (and should not be given to the dog) or are the pearls (that should not be thrown before swine)?
1. (7-11) Jesus calls for perseverance in prayer ([Lk 18:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2018%3A1&version=RSVCE), [Col 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col%204%3A2&version=RSVCE), [1 Thess 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thess%205%3A17&version=RSVCE)). What does Jesus expect that we will ask for in our prayers? [Jas 1:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%201%3A5-8&version=RSVCE). In this saying, bread and fish are good things, while the stone and serpent are bad things. What are the good things that our Father in Heaven wants to give those who ask? [Lk 11:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2011%3A13&version=RSVCE)
1. (12) A formulation of the Golden Rule is found in many of the world's major religions [1 Tim 6:17-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%206%3A17-19&version=RSVCE) and philosophies [Wikipedia Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). In verse 12, Jesus even says that it IS the law and the prophets ("law and the prophets" being shorthand for the OT). It appears in several places in the OT including [Lev 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2019%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Tobit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tob%204%3A15&version=RSVCE), [Sirach](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2031%3A15&version=RSVCE). It is restated in the [2nd Great Commandment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2022%3A36-40&version=RSVCE). If it is of such importance, why do people (including Christians) find it so difficult to put into practice? How can we (personally or even collectively as this group), find ways to love our neighbor more?
1. (13-14) To punctuate Jesus' analogy (about entering the narrow gate to Heaven), consider the following that would have been common images for Jesus' audience. (1) Cities surrounded by a fortified wall had gates to permit access. Main gates were wide and tall enough for caravans of people and animals; smaller gates permitted only pedestrian traffic. *Many* can get through the main gate; *Few* must exert greater effort to enter a narrow pedestrian gate [Mat 22:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2022%3A14&version=RSVCE). (2) The Jerusalem Temple had a series of gates that prohibited entry for the unqualified; only a privileged few had close access to God. This is the teaching of the "two ways". It is common in the OT: [Deut 30:15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2030%3A15-20&version=RSVCE), [Ps 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%201&version=RSVCE). [Wis 5:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wis%205%3A6-7&version=RSVCE). The "two ways" is also found in the [Didache: The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20ways%2C%20one,not%20also%20do%20to%20another.). I suppose the "two ways" is embodied in the modern phrase "What would Jesus do?"  How does reflecting on the narrow gate guide our moral conduct today? 
1. (15-20) Why should we beware the false prophets? What danger do they pose to Christians? [Mat 24:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2024%3A24&version=RSVCE), [2 Peter 2:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202%3A1-3&version=RSVCE) What did the OT say you can tell the difference between true and false prophets? [Deut 18:20-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2018%3A20-22&version=RSVCE), [Jer 14:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2014%3A13-16&version=RSVCE). What do "fruits" represent when Jesus says that you will know them [false prophets] by their "fruits"? Trees that don't bear good fruit are cut down and thrown into the fire. What does it mean for them to be "thrown into the fire"?
1. (21-23) Just acknowledging that Jesus is Lord is not enough to enter the Kingdom of Heaven (one must do the will of "my Father"). What does it mean to do the will of the Father?  Verse 22 in my translation starts with "On that day" .. what day is "on that day"? [Matt 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A31-46&version=RSVCE), [Jn 5:25-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%205%3A25-29&version=RSVCE), [2 Cor 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%205%3A10&version=RSVCE) Works done in His name (such as prophesy and casting out demons), are not enough to enter the kingdom of heaven? What is lacking in these works? [Jn 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2017%3A3&version=RSVCE), [1 Jn 2:3-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%202%3A3-6&version=RSVCE)
1. (24-27) Hearing and DOing the words of Jesus is wise; hearing but not DOing them is foolish. What does it mean for the house to withstand the storms? What does it mean for the house to fall? [Matt 25:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A1-3&version=RSVCE) [Matt 25:1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A1-13&version=RSVCE), [James 2:14-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A14-26&version=RSVCE), [Ps 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20127%3A1&version=RSVCE), [1 Cor 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%203%3A11&version=RSVCE), [Prov 10:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov%2010%3A25&version=RSVCE), [1 Tim 6:17-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%206%3A17-19&version=RSVCE) 
1. (24-27) What OT King would Jesus' reference to a wise man and his house bring to mind in his listeners? [1 Kings 3:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%203%3A10-12&version=RSVCE), [1 Kings 8:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%208%3A27&version=RSVCE), [1 Kings 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%205%3A17&version=RSVCE), [1 Kings 7:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%207%3A10&version=RSVCE), [Is 28:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2028%3A16&version=RSVCE)
1. (28) NOTE: "And when Jesus finished these sayings" .. signals the end of "Book One" of Matthew.
1. (28-29) The crowds were astonished because Jesus taught "with authority" and not as their scribes. How did their scribes teach?  What does it mean to teach with authority? Does it just mean that he was a good and powerful public speaker? Consider some of the language he uses here ..  ([Matt 5:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A21-22&version=RSVCE), [Matt 5:27-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A27-28&version=RSVCE), [Matt 5:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A31-32&version=RSVCE), [Matt 5:33-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A33-34&version=RSVCE), [Matt 5:38-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A38-39&version=RSVCE), [Matt 5:43-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A43-44&version=RSVCE)). Why was this method of teaching astonishing to those first hearing his words?
