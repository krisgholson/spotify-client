## Chapter 9

Book Two: Jesus' Miracles and the Commission of the Twelve, Narrative: Miracle Stories of Jesus

Context: Matthew assembles 10 miracle stories in Chapters 8 and 9; these signs demonstrate that Jesus is the Messiah prophesied in the OT. [see last page here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IbrAF5TRJj90vyF3-0E3qVN-1Fx6pDYB/view?usp=drive_link). They portray Jesus bringing into the world a divine holiness that overpowers the causes of defilement: sin, disease, demons, and even death. The Jews, especially the Pharisees, considered those defiled by these things to be unclean and untouchable; Jesus, however, takes an offensive  stance against evil by his mighty words and physical touch heals the effects of sin. He was not only immune to uncleanness, but the superior power of his holiness went forth to purify others in his midst. These episodes also reveal Jesus' favor with the crowds as well as mounting opposition by skeptical authorities.

### Questions

1. (6-8) The crowds were afraid and glorified God after witnessing the paralytic rise and go home. What "authority" had God given to men (specifically Jesus in this instance)? How and where could sins be forgiven in the Old Covenant?
2. (9) Matthew (the author of this Gospel) is called by Jesus and he "rose and followed him". Matthew was a tax collector. Why were tax collectors so despised by the Jews? What does it say about Jesus that he called those who were considered unrighteous by the religious authorities of the day?
3. (13) Jesus quotes Hosea 6:6. What was the context of the original utterance of the words? God DID ask for sacrifices in the OT - so why did he say in Hosea that he desires mercy and not sacrifice?
4. (14-15) The disciples of John (the Baptist) and the Pharisees fast (a good pious activity) but are surprised that Jesus and His disciples do not. As an answer, Jesus equates himself to the bridegroom at a wedding. The wedding guests (Jesus' disciples) don't fast while Jesus is with them on this earth. When should they fast? When do we fast?
5. (16-17) Checkout Psalm 102:26 to see similar imagery of a garment wearing out. In Jesus' analogies in these verses, what do the "old garment" and "old wineskins" represent? What do the "new/unshrunk cloth" and the "new wine" represent? 
6. (18-26) Jesus raises Jairus' daughter from the dead. Jairus (head of the Capernaum synogogue) had absolute faith that Jesus could heal his daughter from death (and Jesus did). In the process of going to Jairus' house, a woman touches Jesus' garment and is healed of her 12 year hemorrhage. Why did the woman think that simply touching Jesus' garment (even just the fringe) would heal her? (read Malachi 4:2 and keep in mind that "wings" references the 4 corners of a Jewish prayer shawl that are worn by Jewish men.) What are some differences between the woman's healing and Jairus' daughter's healing? What are some similarities?
7. (27-31) Jesus healed the 2 blind men by touching their eyes. We know he can heal without touch; why does he sometimes heal with touch (including using mud and spittle) and sometimes not? Would these blind men still have received their sight if they had answered Jesus' question with "no" or "we're not sure"? 
8. (32-34) The crowds marveled at Jesus' exorcising the demon from the mute (which also restored the man's speech). But, the Pharisees attributed the exorcism to Jesus working in the name of Satan (the prince of demons); what sin have the Pharisees just committed here?
9. (35-37) Jesus provides THE "problem statement" in verse 37. He will give his disciples the power to answer that problem statement in Chapter 10. Compare the summary statement of Jesus' missionary activity (verse 35) with the authority that he gives his disciples in verse 10:1. What is the mission of the Church (our mission)?
