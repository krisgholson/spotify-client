Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 437 (in 'Christ') - God called Joseph to “take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,” so that Jesus, “who is called Christ,” should be born of Joseph’s spouse into the messianic lineage of David (abbreviated) - 333 (in 'Christ with all his angels') - From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels. When God ""brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all God's angels worship him.'"" Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise: ""Glory to God in the highest!"" They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been (abbreviated). - 497 (in 'Mary's Virginity') - The Gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus as a divine work that surpasses all human understanding and possibility: ""That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit"", said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee. The Church sees here the fulfilment of the divine promise given through the prophet Isaiah: ""Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son."" - 486 (in 'Who was Conceived by the Holy Spirit') - The Father’s only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the Virgin Mary, is “Christ,” that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, from the beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples (abbreviated) - 430 (in 'Jesus') - Jesus means in Hebrew: “God saves"" (abbreviated) - 452 (in 'The Only Son of God') - The name Jesus means “God saves.” The child born of the Virgin Mary is called Jesus, “for he will save his people from their sins” (Mt 1:21): “there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). - 1507 (in 'Heal the Sick') - The risen Lord renews this mission (“In my name . . . they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” and confirms it through the signs that the Church performs by invoking his name. These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is truly “God who saves.” - 1846 (in 'Mercy and Sin') - The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God’s mercy to sinners. The angel announced to Joseph: “You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins"" (abbreviated). - 2666 (in 'Prayer to Jesus') - But the one name that contains everything is the one that the Son of God received in his incarnation: Jesus. The divine name may not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our humanity The Word of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: “Jesus,” “YHWH saves"" (abbreviated) - 2812 (in 'Hallowed be Thy Name') - Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his word, and by his sacrifice (abbreviated).

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 535-536 (in 'The Baptism of Jesus') - Jesus’ public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.” A crowd of sinners—tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes—come to be baptized by him. “Then Jesus appears.” The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, “This is my beloved Son.” This is the manifestation (“Epiphany”) of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God’s suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.” Already he is anticipating the “baptism” of his bloody death. Already he is coming to “fulfill all righteousness,” that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father’s will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father’s voice responds to the Son’s acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to “rest on him.” Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism “the heavens were opened”—the heavens that Adam’s sin had closed—and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. - 1286 (in 'Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation') - In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving mission. The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism by John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the Son of God. - 1223-1224 (in 'Christ's Baptism') - All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus.

John preaches “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.” A crowd of sinners—tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes—come to be baptized by him. “Then Jesus appears.” The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, “This is my beloved Son.” This is the manifestation (“Epiphany”) of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God’s suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.” Already he is anticipating the “baptism” of his bloody death. Already he is coming to “fulfill all righteousness,” that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father’s will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father’s voice responds to the Son’s acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to “rest on him.” Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism “the heavens were opened”—the heavens that Adam’s sin had closed—and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation.</p><br/><p>- 1286 (in &#39;Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation&#39;) - In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving mission. The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism by John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the Son of God.</p><br/><p>- 1223-1224 (in &#39;Christ&#39;s Baptism&#39;) - All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus. He begins his public life after having himself baptized by St. John the Baptist in the Jordan...Our Lord voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of St. John, intended for sinners, in order to “fulfill all righteousness.” Jesus’ gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying.

Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: ""You have heard that it was said to the men of old. . . But I say to you. . ."" (abbreviated). - 2153 (in 'Taking the Name of the Lord in Vain') - In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: ""You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you, Do not swear at all.... Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one."" Jesus teaches that every oath involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock. - 592 (in 'Jesus and Israel's faith in the one God and Saviour') - Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf Mt 5:17-19) with such perfection (cf Jn 8:46) that he revealed its ultimate meaning (cf Mt 5:33) and redeemed the transgressions against it (cf Heb 9:15). - 2466 (in 'Living in the Truth') - In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made manifest. ""Full of grace and truth,"" he came as the ""light of the world,"" he is the Truth. ""Whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.""

It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. the Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity. - 2262 (in 'Respect for Human Life') - In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, ""You shall not kill,""and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1716-1717 ('The Beatitudes') - The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. the Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven....The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and portray his charity. They express the vocation of the faithful associated with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations; they proclaim the blessings and rewards already secured, however dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin Mary and all the saints. - 581 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - In Jesus, the same Word of God that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes (abbreviated). - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to ""preach good news to the poor""; he declares them blessed, for ""theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" To them - the ""little ones"" the Father is pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise and the learned (abbreviated). - 2546 (in 'Poverty of Heart') - ""Blessed are the poor in spirit."" The Beatitudes reveal an order of happiness and grace, of beauty and peace. Jesus celebrates the joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already belongs: The Word speaks of voluntary humility as ""poverty in spirit""; the Apostle gives an example of God's poverty when he says: ""For your sakes he became poor."" - 1720 (in 'Christian Beatitude') - The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the beatitude to which God calls man: the vision of God: ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God""...There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall love and praise. Behold what will be at the end without end. For what other end do we have, if not to reach the kingdom which has no end? (abbreviated). - 2518 (in 'Purification of the Heart') - The sixth beatitude proclaims, ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."" ""Pure in heart"" refers to those who have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity; chastity or sexual rectitude; love of truth and orthodoxy of faith. There is a connection between purity of heart, of body, and of faith: The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed ""so that by believing they may obey God, by obeying may live well, by living well may purify their hearts, and with pure hearts may understand what they believe. - 2330 (in 'The Fifth Commandment') - ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God"" - 520 (in 'Our Communion in the mysteries of Jesus') - In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is ""the perfect man"", who invites us to become his disciples and follow him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to imitate, through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to accept freely the privation and persecutions that may come our way.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 577 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a solemn warning in which he presented God's law, given on Sinai during thefirst covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant: Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have come not to abolish but to fulfil. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law, until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. - 592 (in 'Jesus and Israel's Faith in the One God and Saviour') - Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf Mt 5:17-19) with such perfection (cf Jn 8:46) that he revealed its ultimate meaning (cf Mt 5:33) and redeemed the transgressions against it (cf Heb 9:15). - 1967 (in 'The New Law of the Law of the Gospel') - The Law of the Gospel ""fulfills,"" refines, surpasses, and leads the Old Law to its perfection. In the      Beatitudes, the New Law fulfills the divine promises by elevating and orienting them toward the ""kingdom of heaven."" It is addressed to those open to accepting this new hope with faith - the poor, the humble, the afflicted, the pure of heart, those persecuted on account of Christ and so marks out the surprising ways of the Kingdom. - 2053 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - To this first reply Jesus adds a second: ""If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."" This reply does not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. the Law has not been abolished, but rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1716-1717 ('The Beatitudes') - The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. the Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven....The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and portray his charity. They express the vocation of the faithful associated with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations; they proclaim the blessings and rewards already secured, however dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin Mary and all the saints. - 581 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - In Jesus, the same Word of God that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes (abbreviated). - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') - The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to ""preach good news to the poor""; he declares them blessed, for ""theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" To them - the ""little ones"" the Father is pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise and the learned (abbreviated). - 2546 (in 'Poverty of Heart') - ""Blessed are the poor in spirit."" The Beatitudes reveal an order of happiness and grace, of beauty and peace. Jesus celebrates the joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already belongs: The Word speaks of voluntary humility as ""poverty in spirit""; the Apostle gives an example of God's poverty when he says: ""For your sakes he became poor."" - 1720 (in 'Christian Beatitude') - The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the beatitude to which God calls man: the vision of God: ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God""...There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall love and praise. Behold what will be at the end without end. For what other end do we have, if not to reach the kingdom which has no end? (abbreviated). - 2518 (in 'Purification of the Heart') - The sixth beatitude proclaims, ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."" ""Pure in heart"" refers to those who have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity; chastity or sexual rectitude; love of truth and orthodoxy of faith. There is a connection between purity of heart, of body, and of faith: The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed ""so that by believing they may obey God, by obeying may live well, by living well may purify their hearts, and with pure hearts may understand what they believe. - 2330 (in 'The Fifth Commandment') - ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God"" - 520 (in 'Our Communion in the mysteries of Jesus') - In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is ""the perfect man"", who invites us to become his disciples and follow him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to imitate, through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to accept freely the privation and persecutions that may come our way.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1933 (in 'Social Justice') - This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from us. the teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the forgiveness of offenses. He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the New Law, to all enemies. Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy. - 2844 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - 2303 (in 'Peace') - 2842 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect""; ""Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful""...It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and the mercy and the love of our God. Only the Spirit by whom we live can make ""ours"" the same mind that was in Christ Jesus (abbreviated) - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 1825 (in 'Hope') - Christ died out of love for us, while we were still ""enemies."" The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to make ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love children and the poor as Christ himself. - 1968 (in 'The New Law') - The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. the Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity. - 2262 (in 'Respect for Human Life') - In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, ""You shall not kill,""and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies (abbreviated) - 2828 (in 'Give us this day our daily bread') - 1693 (in 'Life in Christ') - Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father,5 and always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father ""who sees in secret,"" in order to become ""perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."" - 2013 (in 'Christian Holiness') - ""All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity.""

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 577 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a solemn warning in which he presented God’s law, given on Sinai during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant: ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law, until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."" - 592 (in 'Jesus and Israel's Faith') - Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf. Mt5:17-19) with such perfection (cf. Jn8:46) that he revealed its ultimate meaning (cf.Mt5:33) and redeemed the transgressions against it (cf. Heb 9:15). - 1967 (in 'The Law of the Gospel') - The Law of the Gospel “fulfills,” refines, surpasses, and leads the Old Law to its perfection. In the Beatitudes, the New Law fulfills the divine promises by elevating and orienting them toward the “kingdom of heaven.” It is addressed to those open to accepting this new hope with faith—the poor, the humble, the afflicted, the pure of heart, those persecuted on account of Christ— and so marks out the surprising ways of the Kingdom. - 2054 (in 'Teacher, what must I do...') - Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the Spirit at work in their letter. He preached a “righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees” as well as that of the Gentiles. He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments. “You have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not kill.’ . . .

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2336 (in 'Male and Female he created them') - Jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins.

But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" What God has joined together, let not man put asunder. The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment as encompassing the whole of human sexuality. - 1456 (in 'The Confession of Sins') - Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament of Penance: ""All mortal sins of which penitents after a diligent self-examination are conscious must be recounted by them in confession, even if they are most secret and have been committed against the last two precepts of the Decalogue; for these sins sometimes wound the soul more grievously and are more dangerous than those which are committed openly."" - 2528 (in 'The Ninth Commandment') - ""Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" - 226 (in 'The Implications of Faith in One God') - It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us away from him: My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me from you. My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you. - 1034 (in 'Hell') - Jesus often speaks of ""Gehenna"" of ""the unquenchable fire"" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. Jesus solemnly proclaims that he ""will send his angels, and they will gather . . . all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,"" and that he will pronounce the condemnation: ""Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!"" - 2382 (in 'Divorce') - The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the Creator who willed that marriage be indissoluble.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2054 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the Spirit at work in their letter. He preached a ""righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees"" as well as that of the Gentiles. - 2262 (in 'The Fifth Commandment') - In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, ""You shall not kill,"" and adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. - 2302 (in 'Peace') - By recalling the commandment, ""You shall not kill,"" our Lord asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and hatred as immoral. - 678 (in 'To Judge the Living and the Dead') - Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus announced the judgement of the Last Day in his preaching. Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to light. Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of God's grace as nothing be condemned. Our attitude to our neighbour will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and divine love. - 1034 (in 'Hell') - Jesus often speaks of ""Gehenna"" of ""the unquenchable fire"" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 2845 (in 'The Seven Petitions') - There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine forgiveness, whether one speaks of ""sins"" as in Luke (11:4), ""debts"" as in Matthew (6:12). We are always debtors: ""Owe no one anything, except to love one another."" - 1424 (in 'The Sacrament of Reconciliation') - It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the sinner the live of God who reconciles: ""Be reconciled to God."" He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call: ""Go; first be reconciled to your brother.""  Got a Bible question?

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1430 (in 'Interior Penance') - Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, ""sackcloth and ashes,"" fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance. - 1969 (in 'The New Law') - The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer and fasting, directing them to the ""Father who sees in secret,"" in contrast with the desire to ""be seen by men."" Its prayer is the Our Father. - 1753 (in 'The Sources of Morality') - A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor) does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying and calumny, good or just. the end does not justify the means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving). - 2447 (in 'Love for the Poor') - The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. the corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead. Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to God. - 1063 (in 'Amen') - Our Lord often used the word ""Amen,"" sometimes repeated, to emphasize the trustworthiness of his teaching, his authority founded on God's truth (abbreviated) - 1693 (in 'Life in Christ') - Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father, and always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father ""who sees in secret,"" in order to become ""perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."" - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 2655 (in 'The Liturgy of the Church') - Even when it is lived out ""in secret,"" prayer is always prayer of the Church; it is a communion with the Holy Trinity. - 2691 (in 'Places favourable for prayer') - For personal prayer, this can be a 'prayer corner' with the Sacred Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our Father.

God's power is loving, for he is our Father, and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it ""is made perfect in weakness"". - 2632 (in 'Prayer of Petition') - Christian petition is centered on the desire and search for the Kingdom to come, in keeping with the teaching of Christ.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2113 (in 'Idolatry') - Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, ""You cannot serve God and mammon."" Many martyrs died for not adoring ""the Beast"" refusing even to simulate such worship. Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God. - 2424 (in 'The Social Doctrine of the Church') - A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of the many conflicts which disturb the social order. A system that ""subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of groups to the collective organization of production"" is contrary to human dignity. Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and contributes to the spread of atheism. ""You cannot serve God and mammon."" - 2729 (in 'Facing Difficulties in Prayer') - The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction.

It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, &#34;You cannot serve God and mammon.&#34; Many martyrs died for not adoring &#34;the Beast&#34; refusing even to simulate such worship. Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God.</p><br/><p>- 2424 (in &#39;The Social Doctrine of the Church&#39;) - A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of the many conflicts which disturb the social order. A system that &#34;subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of groups to the collective organization of production&#34; is contrary to human dignity. Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and contributes to the spread of atheism. &#34;You cannot serve God and mammon.&#34;</p><br/><p>- 2729 (in &#39;Facing Difficulties in Prayer&#39;) - The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect words and their meaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more profoundly, him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or personal), meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set about hunting down distractions would be to fall into their trap, when all that is necessary is to turn back to our heart: for a distraction reveals to us what we are attached to, and this humble awareness before the Lord should awaken our preferential love for him and lead us resolutely to offer him our heart to be purified.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2759-2856 - Entire section of the Catechism which covers the Our Father. - 2608 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. This filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father. - 2668 (in 'Prayer to Jesus') - The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases, but holds fast to the word and ""brings forth fruit with patience."" This prayer is possible ""at all times"" because it is not one occupation among others but the only occupation: that of loving God, which animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus. - 443 (in 'The Only Son of God') - He distinguished his sonship from that of his disciples by never saying ""our Father"", except to command them: ""You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father'"", and he emphasized this distinction, saying ""my Father and your Father"" (abbreviated) - 2736 (in 'Filial Trust') - Are we asking God for ""what is good for us""? Our Father knows what we need before we ask him, but he awaits our petition because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom. We must pray, then, with his Spirit of freedom, to be able truly to know what he wants. - 1969 (in 'The New Law') - The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer and fasting, directing them to the ""Father who sees in secret,"" in contrast with the desire to ""be seen by men."" Its prayer is the Our Father. - 268 (in 'The Almighty') - of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is named in the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our lives. We believe that his might is universal, for God who created everything also rules everything and can do everything. God's power is loving, for he is our Father, and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it ""is made perfect in weakness"". - 2632 (in 'Prayer of Petition') - Christian petition is centered on the desire and search for the Kingdom to come, in keeping with the teaching of Christ. There is a hierarchy in these petitions: we pray first for the Kingdom, then for what is necessary to welcome it and cooperate with its coming. .. By prayer every baptized person works for the coming of the Kingdom (abbreviated) - 2659 (in 'Today') - We learn to pray at certain moments by hearing the Word of the Lord and sharing in his Paschal mystery, but his Spirit is offered us at all times, in the events of each day, to make prayer spring up from us. Jesus' teaching about praying to our Father is in the same vein as his teaching about providence: time is in the Father's hands; it is in the present that we encounter him, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today: ""O that today you would hearken to his voice!

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1789 (in 'To Choose in accord with conscience') - Some rules apply in every case: - One may never do evil so that good may result from it; - the Golden Rule: ""whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them"" (abbreviated). - 1970 (in 'The New Law') - The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice between ""the two ways"" and to put into practice the words of the Lord. It is summed up in the Golden Rule, ""Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the prophets."" - 1036 (in 'Hell') - The affirmations of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of the Church on the subject of hell are a call to the responsibility incumbent upon man to make use of his freedom in view of his eternal destiny. They are at the same time an urgent call to conversion: ""Enter by the narrow gate;      for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few."" - 1696 (in 'Life in Christ') - The way of Christ ""leads to life""; a contrary way ""leads to destruction."" The Gospel parable of the two ways remains ever present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of moral decisions for our salvation: ""There are two ways, the one of life, the other of death; but between the two, there is a great difference."" - 2609 (in 'Jesus teaches us how to pray') - Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He can ask us to ""seek"" and to ""knock,"" since he himself is the door and the way.  Got a Bible question?

For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.&#34;</p><br/><p>- 1696 (in &#39;Life in Christ&#39;) - The way of Christ &#34;leads to life&#34;; a contrary way &#34;leads to destruction.&#34; The Gospel parable of the two ways remains ever present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of moral decisions for our salvation: &#34;There are two ways, the one of life, the other of death; but between the two, there is a great difference.&#34;</p><br/><p>- 2609 (in &#39;Jesus teaches us how to pray&#39;) - Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He can ask us to &#34;seek&#34; and to &#34;knock,&#34; since he himself is the door and the way.</p><br/><p><br /></p><br/><p>Got a Bible question?

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2285 (in 'Respect for the Souls of Others: Scandal') - Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized.

Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others.

We cannot therefore rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are justified and saved. However, according to the Lord's words ""Thus you will know them by their fruits"" - reflection on God's blessings in our life and in the lives of the saints offers us a guarantee that grace is at work in us and spurs us on to an ever greater faith and an attitude of trustful poverty. A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply of St. Joan of Arc to a question posed as a trap by her ecclesiastical judges: ""Asked if she knew that she was in God's grace, she replied: 'If I am not, may it please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me there.'""

But ""soul"" also refers to the innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him, that by which he is most especially in God's image: ""soul"" signifies the spiritual principle in man. - 1034 (in 'Hell') - Jesus often speaks of ""Gehenna"" of ""the unquenchable fire"" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. Jesus solemnly proclaims that he ""will send his angels, and they will gather . . . all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,"" and that he will pronounce the condemnation: ""Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!"" - 305 (in 'God Carries out his plan: Divine Providence') - Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our heavenly Father who takes care of his children's smallest needs: ""Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ""What shall we eat?"" or ""What shall we drink?"". . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well."" - 1816 (in 'Faith') - The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith and live on it, but also profess it, confidently bear witness to it, and spread it: ""All however must be prepared to confess Christ before men and to follow him along the way of the Cross, amidst the persecutions which the Church never lacks."" Service of and witness to the faith are necessary for salvation: ""So every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven."" - 14 (in 'Prologue') - Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism must confess their baptismal faith before men (abbreviated). - 2145 (in 'The Name of the Lord is Holy') - The faithful should bear witness to the Lord's name by confessing the faith without giving way to fear. Preaching and catechizing should be permeated with adoration and respect for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Got a Bible question?

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2603 (in 'Jesus Prays') - The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes. His exclamation, ""Yes, Father!"" expresses the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father's ""good pleasure,"" echoing his mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of the Father. - 2701 (in 'Vocal Prayer') - Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the liturgical prayers of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to express his personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the agony of Gesthemani. - 2785 (in 'Abba-Father') - Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us ""to turn and become like children"": for it is to ""little children"" that the Father is revealed. [The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God alone, and by the warmth of love, through which the soul, molded and directed to love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to its own Father with special devotion (abbreviated). - 240 (in 'The Father Revealed by the Son') - Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his relationship to his only Son who is eternally Son only in relation to his Father: ""No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."" - 473 (in 'Christ's Soul and his human knowledge') - But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's Son expressed the divine life of his person. ""The human nature of God's Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God."" Such is first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made man has of his Father (abbreviated). - 459 (in 'Why did the Word become Flesh') - The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me.” “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me"" (abbreviated). - 1615 (in 'Marriage in the Lord') - This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy—heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to “receive” the original meaning of marriage and live it with the help of Christ (abbreviated). - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God') Got a Bible question?

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2603 (in 'Jesus Prays') - The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes. His exclamation, ""Yes, Father!"" expresses the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father's ""good pleasure,"" echoing his mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of the Father. - 2701 (in 'Vocal Prayer') - Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the liturgical prayers of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to express his personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the agony of Gesthemani. - 2785 (in 'Abba-Father') - Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us ""to turn and become like children"": for it is to ""little children"" that the Father is revealed. [The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God alone, and by the warmth of love, through which the soul, molded and directed to love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to its own Father with special devotion (abbreviated). - 240 (in 'The Father Revealed by the Son') - Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his relationship to his only Son who is eternally Son only in relation to his Father: ""No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."" - 473 (in 'Christ's Soul and his human knowledge') - But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's Son expressed the divine life of his person. ""The human nature of God's Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God."" Such is first of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made man has of his Father (abbreviated). - 459 (in 'Why did the Word become Flesh') - The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me.” “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me"" (abbreviated). - 1615 (in 'Marriage in the Lord') - This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy—heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to “receive” the original meaning of marriage and live it with the help of Christ (abbreviated). - 544 (in 'The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God')  Got a Bible question?

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 2603 (in 'Jesus Prays') - The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes. His exclamation, ""Yes, Father!"" expresses the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father's ""good pleasure,"" echoing his mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of the Father. - 2701 (in 'Vocal Prayer') - Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the liturgical prayers of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to express his personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the agony of Gesthemani. - 2785 (in 'Abba-Father') - Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us ""to turn and become like children"": for it is to ""little children"" that the Father is revealed.

However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy—heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God.

The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God. “The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.” - 586 (in 'Jesus and the Temple') - Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the essential part of his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the Temple-tax, associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the foundation of his future Church.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 424 (in 'The Good News: God has sent his son') - Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father, we believe in Jesus and confess: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'8 On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter, Christ built his Church. - 881 (in 'The Episcopal Colleage and its head, the Pope') - The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the ""rock"" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock. ""The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles united to its head."" This pastoral office of Peter and the other apostles belongs to the Church's very foundation and is continued by the bishops under the primacy of the Pope. - 552-553 (in 'The Keys to the Kingdom') - Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve; Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a revelation from the Father, Peter had confessed: ""You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."" Our Lord then declared to him: ""You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."" Christ, the ""living Stone"",thus assures his Church, built on Peter, of victory over the powers of death. Because of the faith he confessed Peter will remain the unshakable rock of the Church. His mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it. Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: ""I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.""287 The ""power of the keys"" designates authority to govern the house of God, which is the Church. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection: ""Feed my sheep.""288 The power to ""bind and loose"" connotes the authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgments, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church. Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through the ministry of the apostles289 and in particular through the ministry of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted the keys of the kingdom. - 869 (in 'The Church is Apostolic') - The Church is apostolic. She is built on a lasting foundation: ""the twelve apostles of the Lamb"" (Rev 21:14). She is indestructible (cf. Mt 16:18). She is upheld infallibly in the truth: Christ governs her through Peter and the other apostles, who are present in their successors, the Pope and the college of bishops. - 1444 (in 'Reconciliation with the Church') - In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most notably in Christ's solemn words to Simon Peter: ""I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.""

She is upheld infallibly in the truth: Christ governs her through Peter and the other apostles, who are present in their successors, the Pope and the college of bishops.</p><br/><p>- 1444 (in &#39;Reconciliation with the Church&#39;) - In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most notably in Christ&#39;s solemn words to Simon Peter: &#34;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#34; &#34;The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of the apostles united to its head.&#34;</p><br/><p><br /></p><br/><p>Got a Bible question?

Lastly, he is present when the Church prays and sings, for he has promised 'where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them"" (abbreviated). - 1373 (in 'The Presence of Christ by the power of his word and the Holy Spirit') - ""Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us,"" is present in many ways to his Church: in his word, in his Church's prayer, ""where two or three are gathered in my name,"" in the poor, the sick, and the imprisoned (abbreviated).

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 1614-1615 (in 'Marriage in the Lord') - In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts. The matrimonial union of man and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it ""what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder."" This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to ""receive"" the original meaning of marriage and live it with the help of Christ. This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit of Christ's cross, the source of all Christian life. - 1618 (in 'Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom') - Christ is the center of all Christian life. the bond with him takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social. From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming. Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he remains the model: ""For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."" - 1579 (in 'Who can receive this sacrament?') - All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate ""for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."" Called to consecrate themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to ""the affairs of the Lord,"" they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God. - 922 (in 'Consecrated Virgins') - From apostolic times Christian virgins and widows, called by the Lord to cling only to him with greater freedom of heart, body, and spirit, have decided with the Church's approval to live in a state of virginity ""for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven."" - 2364 (in 'Conjugal Fidelity') - 2380 (in 'Adultery') - 2382 (in' Divorce') - 2400 (in 'The Sixth Commandment') - 1605 (in 'Marriage in the Order of Creation') - 1610 (in 'Marriage under the pedagogy of the Law') - 1620 (in 'Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom') - 1644 (in 'The Unity and Indissolubility of Marriage') - 1652 (in 'The Openness to Fertility')  Got a Bible question?

Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself. To this first reply Jesus adds a second: ""If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."" This reply does not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. the Law has not been abolished, but rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity. The evangelical counsels are inseparable from the Commandments. - 2075 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - ""What good deed must I do, to have eternal life?"" - ""If you would enter into life, keep the commandments.""

No one can command or establish what is contrary to the dignity of persons and the natural law.</p><br/><p>- 440 (in &#39;Christ&#39;) - He unveiled the authentic content of his messianic kingship both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man &#34;who came down from heaven&#34;, and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant: &#34;The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&#34; (abbreviated)</p><br/><p>- 601 (in &#39;He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures&#39;) - The Scriptures had foretold this divine plan of salvation through the putting to death of &#34;the righteous one, my Servant&#34; as a mystery of universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that would free men from the slavery of sin. (abbreviated)</p><br/><p>- 605 (in &#39;He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures&#39;) - He affirms that he came &#34;to give his life as a ransom for many&#34;; this last term is not restrictive, but contrasts the whole of humanity with the unique person of the redeemer who hands himself over to save us.</p><br/><p>- 622 (in &#39;Christ offered himself to his Father for our sins&#39;) - The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he came &#34;to give his life as a ransom for many&#34; (Mt 20:28), that is, he &#34;loved [his own] to the end&#34; (Jn 13:1), so that they might be &#34;ransomed from the futile ways inherited from [their] fathers&#34; (I Pt 1:18).</p><br/><p>- 786 (in &#39;A Priestly, prophetic and royal people&#39;) - Finally, the People of God shares in the royal office of Christ. He exercises his kingship by drawing all men to himself through his death and Resurrection. Christ, King and Lord of the universe, made himself the servant of all, for he came &#34;not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&#34; For the Christian, &#34;to reign is to serve him,&#34; particularly when serving &#34;the poor and the suffering, in whom the Church recognizes the image of her poor and suffering founder.&#34; The People of God fulfills its royal dignity by a life in keeping with its vocation to serve with Christ.</p><br/><p><br /></p><br/><p>Got a Bible question?

On that land the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about and will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has been planted by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who gives life and fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through the Church remain in Christ, without whom we can do nothing. &#34;Often, too, the Church is called the building of God. the Lord compared himself to the stone which the builders rejected, but which was made into the comer-stone. On this foundation the Church is built by the apostles and from it the Church receives solidity and unity. This edifice has many names to describe it: the house of God in which his family dwells; the household of God in the Spirit; the dwelling-place of God among men; and, especially, the holy temple. This temple, symbolized in places of worship built out of stone, is praised by the Fathers and, not without reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. As living stones we here on earth are built into it. It is this holy city that is seen by John as it comes down out of heaven from God when the world is made anew, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.&#34;</p><br/><p>- 443 (in &#39;The Only Son of God&#39;) - Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Messiah&#39;s divine sonship because Jesus had clearly allowed it to be so understood. To his accusers&#39; question before the Sanhedrin, &#34;Are you the Son of God, then?&#34; Jesus answered, &#34;You say that I am.&#34; Well before this, Jesus referred to himself as &#34;the Son&#34; who knows the Father, as distinct from the &#34;servants&#34; God had earlier sent to his people; he is superior even to the angels (abbreviated).</p><br/><p><br /></p><br/><p>Got a Bible question?

Jesus replies: ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is thegreatest and first commandment. and a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.""

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 581 (in 'Jesus and the Law') - The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi. He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the Law. Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people ""as one who had authority, and not as their scribes"" (abbreviated). - 2055 (in 'The Ten Commandments') - When someone asks him, ""Which commandment in the Law is the greatest?"" Jesus replies: ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is thegreatest and first commandment. and a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets."" The Decalogue must be interpreted in light of this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law: the commandments: ""You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,"" and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence: ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. - 2083 (in 'you Shall love the Lord to your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind') - Jesus summed up man's duties toward God in this saying: ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and      with all your soul, and with all your mind. This immediately echoes the solemn call: ""Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD."" God has loved us first. the love of the One God is recalled in the first of the ""ten words."" the commandments then make explicit the response of love that man is called to give to his God. - 1824 (in 'Charity') - Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps the commandments of God and his Christ: ""Abide in my love.

Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraphs: - 500 (in 'Mary ever-virgin') - Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus. The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, ""brothers of Jesus"", are the sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls ""the other Mary"". They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression. - 2174 (in 'the Day of the Resurrection: the new Creation') - Jesus rose from the dead ""on the first day of the week."" Because it is the ""first day,"" the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the first creation.      Because it is the ""eighth day"" following the sabbath, it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday:  ""We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead."" - 641 (in 'The Empty Tomb') - Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish anointing the body of Jesus, which had been buried in haste because the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the first to encounter the Risen One. Thus the women were the first messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves (abbreviated). - 654 (in 'The Meaning and Saving Significance of the Resurrection') - Justification consists in both victory over the death caused by sin and a new participation ingrace. It brings about filial adoption so that men become Christ's brethren, as Jesus himself called his disciples after his Resurrection: ""Go and tell my brethren."" We are brethren not by nature, but by the gift of grace, because that adoptive filiation gains us a real share in the life of the only Son, which was fully revealed in his Resurrection (abbreviated).
