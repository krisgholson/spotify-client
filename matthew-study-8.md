### Questions

1. (Notes, Chapters 8 & 9) Matthew assembles 10 miracle stories. They portray Jesus bringing into the world a divine holiness that overpowers the causes of defilement: sin, disease, demons, and even death. The Jews, especially the Pharisees, considered those defiled by these things to be unclean and untouchable; Jesus, however, takes an offensive  stance against evil by his mighty words and physical touch heals the effects of sin. He was not only immune to uncleanness, but the superior power of his holiness went forth to purify others in his midst. These episodes also reveal Jesus' favor with the crowds as well as mounting opposition by skeptical authorities.
1. (1) Note the crowds ALREADY following Jesus down the mountain just from His teaching during the Sermon on the Mount; keep this in mind as we watch him start to perform mighty works and miracles.  
1. (2-3) If someone had leprosy during Biblical times, what was the impact on their life? [Lev 13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2013-14&version=RSVCE) Why was Jesus' healing of the leper so shocking? While this was a blessing for the leper that was healed (and for all those healed), how does this work also serve as Jesus' proof of identify as the Messiah? [Matt 11:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2011%3A5&version=RSVCE) 
1. (4) Why the command from Jesus to the leper to show himself to the priest and to offer a gift? [Lev 13:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2013%3A1-3&version=RSVCE), [Matt 11:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2011%3A5&version=RSVCE) Why did Jesus tell the leper to say nothing to anyone?
1. (5-13) What additional detail does Luke give us about this centurion? [Lk 7:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%207%3A5&version=RSVCE) Jesus makes a big deal ("Truly I say to you") about the faith of the Gentile centurion as compared to the faith of the Jews - God's chosen people. What does the centurion's statement reveal about his understanding of who Jesus is? To "sit at table" with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob alludes to an OT promise of a great feast to accompany the messianic age [Is 25:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2025%3A6-9&version=RSVCE). What was God's covenant oath to Abraham that was later renewed by Isaac and Jacob? [Gen 22:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2022%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Gen 26:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2026%3A3-5&version=RSVCE), [Gen 28:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2028%3A14&version=RSVCE)
1. (17) Matthew paraphrases Isaiah [Is 53:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2053%3A4&version=RSVCE)  How are physical afflictions healed by Jesus equated to sin? [1 Peter 2:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202%3A24-25&version=RSVCE), [Is 53:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2053%3A5-6&version=RSVCE)
1. (18-22) What message is Jesus sending these 2 disciples about what it means to follow Him? Burial was a sacred duty in ancient Judaism [Gen 50:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2050%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Tob 4:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tob%204%3A3-4&version=RSVCE). What does Jesus mean by "leave the dead to bury their own dead"?  The request of the 2nd disciple sounds a little bit like Elisha's call to follow Elijah (except Elisha was permitted to fulfill parental duties) - does this say anything about the difference between NT discipleship and OT discipleship?
1. (23-27) Compare this episode with Jonah's experience at sea when fleeing God's call. [Jon 1:1-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jon%201%3A1-16&version=RSVCE) Where else is Jesus associated with Jonah? [Matt 12:39-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2012%3A39-41&version=RSVCE), [Matt 16:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2016%3A4&version=RSVCE)
1. (28-34) Jesus drives out demons from 2 demoniacs in a predominantly Gentile area. The demons recognize Jesus as the "son of God" - what is significant about this? What do they mean by "before the time" when they ask if Jesus is here to torment them before the time? Before what time?  Why did the people of the city beg Jesus to leave after hearing about this episode from the herdsman?
