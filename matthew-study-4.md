## Chapter 4 
Book One: John the Baptist and the Early Ministry of Jesus, Narrative: Ministry of John and Jesus

### Questions 
1. (4:2) Why "40 days and 40 nights" of fasting?  [Ex 4:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%204%3A22&version=RSVCE) (Israel as first born son), [Num 14:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2014%3A34&version=RSVCE) (spy out the land), [Ex 24:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2024%3A18&version=RSVCE) (Moses on the mountain), [1 Cor 10:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2010%3A1-5&version=RSVCE) (baptism BEFORE wilderness)
1. (4:4, 7, 10) Jesus responds to the devil's 3 temptations with scripture - all from Deuteronomy: [Deut 8:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%208%3A3&version=RSVCE) (manna), [Deut 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%206%3A16&version=RSVCE) (Massah), [Deut 6:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%206%3A13-15&version=RSVCE) (Him only) What contrast can we make concerning Jesus' time in the desert to Israel's time in the desert?
1. (4:6) Satan knows Scripture. But how does Satan misconstrue Psalm 91? [Ps 91](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2091&version=RSVCE)
1. (4:8-9) In the devil's 3rd temptation, he offered Jesus "all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them" in exchange for Jesus' worship - what does this tell us about Satan's role in the current world?
1. (4:11) When else in Scripture do we find an angel ministering to Jesus? [Lk 22:41-43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2022%3A41-43&version=RSVCE)
1. What is OUR wilderness trial on our way to Heaven? 
1. (4:12) After completing 40 days in the desert, was it significant that Jesus moved locations from the south of Israel to the north of Israel "when he heard that John had been arrested"? 
1. (4:13) Note: Judean Wilderness / Desert outside of Jerusalem in southern Israel => 30 hour walk => Nazareth in Galilee in  northern Israel (family home, small village) => 9 hour walk => Capernaum in Galilee  (bustling fishing village - where Peter and some other disciples live - now home base for His ministry)
1. (4:15) In Isaiah's prophecy [Is 9:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%209%3A1-2&version=RSVCE), why were the people sitting in darkness? [2 Kings 15:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2015%3A29&version=RSVCE).  What does Matthew interpret as the "great light"? Jesus is reconstituting the Kingdom from the very location where the old kingdom first started to unravel. 
1. (4:17) Boom goes the dynamite - Jesus public ministry starts! What is Jesus' main message of ministry? This is consistent with John the Baptist's message.
1. (4:18-22) The fist disciples were called and immediately left their lives. Why were they so quick to follow Him; what did they know about Him? [John 1:35-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A35-42&version=RSVCE), [Luke 5:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205%3A1-10&version=RSVCE)
1. (4:23) "gospel" == "evangelion" == "good news" According to [Hayden](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4gEshgd3eFTjOWXTq29vXE) (and [others](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/what-does-word-gospel-mean/)), what did "gospel" mean in the context of the day?  With that perspective in mind, read two verses often pointed to as Paul's description of the gospel? [Romans 1:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A1-6&version=RSVCE), [1 Cor 15:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015%3A1-11&version=RSVCE) How do they sound different or similar to each other?
