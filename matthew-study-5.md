## Chapter 5

Book One: John the Baptist and the Early Ministry of Jesus, Discourse: Sermon on the Mount

### Questions (Beatitudes)

1. We are starting Jesus first discourse in Matthew - the Sermon on the Mount. Let's begin with the end purpose of the discourse in mind - what does Jesus say about those who hear his words and do them (and also about those who hear his words and DON'T do them) - [7:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%207%3A24-27&version=RSVCE). [Jas 2:14-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%202%3A14-26&version=RSVCE), [1 Tim 6:17-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%206%3A17-19&version=RSVCE) 
1. (5:1) Jesus went up the mountain to teach ([Ex 19-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2019-24&version=RSVCE)) and he sat; what is important about these seemingly small details?
1. (5:3-11) "Blessed". What does it mean? Is Jesus talking about present or future blessings? 
1. (5:3) "Poor in spirit". What does this mean? Financially poor? [Jas 2:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%202%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Matt 25:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A34&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:4) "Mourn". What do we mourn for? How will we be comforted? [Rev 7:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%207%3A17&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:5) "Meek". Does this simply mean weak? If not what does it mean? [Num 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2012%3A3&version=RSVCE), [Mt 11:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2011%3A29&version=RSVCE), [Mt 21:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2021%3A5&version=RSVCE) What does it mean to inherit the earth? [Ps 37:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2037%3A11&version=RSVCE), [Heb 11:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2011%3A16&version=RSVCE), [Rom 8:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%208%3A21&version=RSVCE), [Rev 21:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2021%3A1&version=RSVCE) 
1. (5:6) "Hunger and thirst for righteousnes". What does this mean? [Matt 6:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%206%3A33&version=RSVCE), [Jn 4:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%204%3A34&version=RSVCE) How will we be satisfied? [Matt 25:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A46&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:7) "Merciful". How should we be merciful? [Lk 6:32-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%206%3A32-36&version=RSVCE), [Mt 18:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2018%3A21-22&version=RSVCE), [Mt 18:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2018%3A33&version=RSVCE) When will we obtain mercy? [Jas 2:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%202%3A13&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:8) "Pure in heart". What do we think of when we hear "heart" today? What did it mean in Biblical times? What does "pure" mean? What does it mean to "see God"? [Matt 18:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2018%3A10&version=RSVCE), [1 Cor 13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2013%3A12&version=RSVCE), [Rev 22:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2022%3A4&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:9) "Peacemakers". Who are peacemakers? [Jas 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%203%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Heb 12:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2012%3A14&version=RSVCE), [Rom 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%205%3A1&version=RSVCE), [Phil 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%204%3A7&version=RSVCE) What does it mean to be sons of God? [Rom 8:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%208%3A14-16&version=RSVCE), [1 Jn 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%203%3A1&version=RSVCE), [Rom 8:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%208%3A23&version=RSVCE), [Rev 21:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2021%3A7&version=RSVCE)
1. (5:10) "Persecuted for righteousness' sake". Why are we persecuted for righteousness' sake? [Jn 15:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2015%3A18&version=RSVCE) Why should we rejoice because of that persecution? [1 Pet 3:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pet%203%3A14&version=RSVCE)

###  Questions (Salt and Light, Fulfillment of Law & Prophets, Anger, Adultery, Divorce)

1. (13-16) Salt and light. How were salt and light used in the OT to define Israel's relationship with God and God's purpose for them in the world? [Num 18:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2018%3A19&version=RSVCE), [2 Chron 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chron%2013%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Is 42:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2042%3A6&version=RSVCE), [Is 49:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2049%3A6&version=RSVCE) What is a "convenant of salt"?
1. (16) Note: this is the first time in Matthew that he mentions God's Fatherhood. He will go on to call God "Father" 17 times in the Sermon on the Mount. 
1. (17) What are some ways that Matthew has already demonstrated that Jesus "fulfills" (or "makes complete") the "law and the prophets" (the OT)? (1:23, 2:6, 2:15, 4:15-16). Jesus makes it a point to explain (road to Emmaus and to his disciples) that he must fulfil the OT [Lk 24:44-47](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024%3A44-47&version=RSVCE).
1. (18) What does Jesus mean by "until all is accomplished"? Until **what** is accomplished?
1. (19) There is those who are "least" in heaven and those who are "great" in the Kingdom of Heaven based on what they do. Is this surprising?
1. (20) The scribes and Pharisees were righteous in their exterior conduct, yet Jesus' words indicate that we need to be MORE righteousness than they just to ENTER the Kingdom of Heaven. How did the scribes and Pharisees miss the mark?
1. (21-22) Jesus begins to deepen the meaning of the OT Law starting with murder. In 22, it sounds like there are degrees of personal guilt based on conduct (anger->judgment <  insult->council < vicious insult->hell). Are all sins equal? [1 John 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A17&version=RSVCE)
1. (27-30) Even looking and thinking "lustfully" counts as breaking the New Law. Jesus gives us some hyperbolic remedies to avoid these occasions of sin, the sins themselves, and the eternal punishment they lead to. [Matt 18:7-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2018%3A7-9&version=RSVCE) How is this hyperbole necessary to underscore the severity of sexual sins?
1. (31-32) Does Jesus permit divorce?

### Notes

#### Blessed word study 
(from Ignatius Catholic Study Bible)

Blessed (5:3-10)
Makarios (Gk): An adjective meaning "fortunate" or "blessed". It is found 13 times in Matthew and 37 times elsewhere in
the NT. The term is not used as an invocation of God's blessing but as a declaration that a person has either received a
blessing from God ([Mt 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016%3A17&version=RSVCE); [Rom 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%204%3A7&version=RSVCE)) or can expect to receive his blessing in the future ([Jas 1:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%201%3A12&version=RSVCE); [Rev 14:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2014%3A13&version=RSVCE); [Rev 22:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2022%3A14&version=RSVCE)).
This distinction has its roots in the OT, where wisdom beatitudes congratulate those who enjoy divine benefits and
favorable circumstances in the present ([Job 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%205%3A17&version=RSVCE); [Prov 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Prov%203%3A13&version=RSVCE); [Sir 25:8- 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2025%3A8-%209&version=RSVCE)) and eschatological beatitudes promise the
rewards and consolations of God in the future ([Ps 1:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%201%3A1-6&version=RSVCE), [Is 30:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2030%3A18&version=RSVCE); [Dan 12:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%2012%3A12&version=RSVCE)). The beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount
are of the latter type, for they announce that the blessings of the New Covenant will be fully realized in heaven. Some
do promise blessings that are partly enjoyed in this life, but all of them look beyond the struggles and hardships of
this life to the eternal blessedness of the life to come ([5:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%205%3A11-12&version=RSVCE)).
